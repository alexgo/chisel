<h3 id="boost-code-explanation">Boost Code Explanation</h3>
<p>Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 1:01:39 PM PDT</p>
<p>This is a Dockerfile, which is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is divided into two stages: the build stage and the run stage.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build Stage:</li>
</ol>
<p>The build stage is where the application is built. It starts with the <code>FROM golang:alpine AS build</code> command which pulls the golang:alpine image from Docker Hub. This is a lightweight Go (Golang) Docker image based on Alpine Linux.</p>
<p><code>RUN apk update &amp;&amp; apk add git</code> is used to update the package list and install git in the image. Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.</p>
<p><code>ADD . /src</code> adds the contents of the current directory (on the host) to the <code>/src</code> directory in the image.</p>
<p><code>WORKDIR /src</code> changes the working directory of the Docker image to <code>/src</code>.</p>
<p><code>ENV CGO_ENABLED 0</code> sets an environment variable in the Docker image. CGO_ENABLED is a Go environment variable that enables or disables the use of CGo in Go programs.</p>
<p>The <code>RUN go build</code> command is used to build the Go application. The <code>-ldflags</code> option allows you to set linker options. The <code>-X</code> flag is a linker option that allows you to set the value of an uninitialized string variable in the Go source code. In this case, it&#39;s setting the value of the <code>github.com/jpillora/chisel/share.BuildVersion</code> variable to the output of the <code>git describe --abbrev=0 --tags</code> command.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Run Stage:</li>
</ol>
<p>The run stage is where the built application is run. It starts with <code>FROM scratch</code>, which creates a brand new, empty Docker image.</p>
<p><code>LABEL maintainer=&quot;dev@jpillora.com&quot;</code> sets metadata on the Docker image. In this case, it&#39;s setting the maintainer of the image.</p>
<p><code>COPY --from=build /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/</code> copies the SSL certificates from the build image to the run image. This is necessary for the application to make secure connections.</p>
<p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory of the Docker image to <code>/app</code>.</p>
<p><code>COPY --from=build /tmp/bin /app/bin</code> copies the built application from the build image to the run image.</p>
<p><code>ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/app/bin&quot;]</code> sets the application that will be run when a container is started from the image.</p>

<p>Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 1:03:02 PM PDT</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 6/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Insecure Dockerfile practices</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Dockerfile uses the &#39;latest&#39; tag for the golang:alpine image. This can lead to non-reproducible builds, as &#39;latest&#39; can point to any version. It&#39;s better to pin specific versions of images to ensure the build is reproducible and to avoid unexpected behavior due to changes in the image.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Replace &#39;golang:alpine&#39; with a specific version like &#39;golang:1.16-alpine&#39;. Refer to Docker&#39;s best practices for more details: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#from">https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#from</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 4/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Insecure Dockerfile practices</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Dockerfile uses &#39;apk add git&#39; without specifying a version, which can lead to non-reproducible builds and potential exposure to vulnerabilities in unpatched versions.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Specify a version for git when adding it. For example: &#39;apk add git=<version>&#39;. Refer to Docker&#39;s best practices for more details: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#run">https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#run</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 8/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 2</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Insecure Dockerfile practices</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Dockerfile uses &#39;ADD&#39; to copy files into the Docker image. &#39;ADD&#39; has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that can lead to unexpected and potentially insecure results. &#39;COPY&#39; is more secure and should be used instead.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Replace &#39;ADD . /src&#39; with &#39;COPY . /src&#39;. Refer to Docker&#39;s best practices for more details: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy">https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 9</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Insecure Dockerfile practices</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Dockerfile uses &#39;FROM scratch&#39; for the run stage. This means the container runs without an operating system, which can limit the debugging capabilities and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Consider using a minimal base image like &#39;alpine&#39; instead of &#39;scratch&#39;. This provides a minimal set of tools for debugging without significantly increasing the size of the image. Refer to Docker&#39;s best practices for more details: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#from">https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#from</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 5/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Disk</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The use of the &#39;apk update&#39; command without the &#39;--no-cache&#39; flag can lead to increased disk usage because it leaves behind a cache of the downloaded packages.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Use the &#39;--no-cache&#39; flag with the &#39;apk update&#39; command to avoid unnecessary disk usage. The command would look like this: &#39;apk update --no-cache&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 4/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 3</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Disk</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The &#39;ADD .&#39; command copies all files from the current directory into the Docker image, which could include unnecessary files and increase the size of the image.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Use a .dockerignore file to specify which files should not be copied into the Docker image. Alternatively, use the COPY command instead of ADD, as it is more transparent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 3/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 7</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: CPU</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The &#39;go build&#39; command without the &#39;-i&#39; flag can lead to longer build times because it does not install the packages that are being compiled.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Use the &#39;-i&#39; flag with the &#39;go build&#39; command to install the packages that are being compiled. The command would look like this: &#39;go build -i&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: HIPAA</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The code is adding the entire directory to the Docker image. If the directory contains sensitive data, it could be exposed in the image.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Only add necessary files to the Docker image. Use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 8</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: GDPR</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The code is copying SSL certificates into the Docker image. If the certificates are not properly secured, they could be exposed in the image.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Secure the certificates before copying them into the Docker image. Use a secure method such as Docker secrets to manage sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 8/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 10</p>
