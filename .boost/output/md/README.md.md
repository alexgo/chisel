### Boost Architectural Quick Summary Security Report

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 12:49:28 PM PDT

Executive Level Report:

1. **Architectural Impact**: The software project appears to have a single file, README.md, which is unusual for a software project. This could indicate that the project is in its early stages or that the project's source code is not being properly detected. The architectural impact of the issues found is significant, as they indicate potential vulnerabilities in the project's security architecture.

2. **Risk Analysis**: The project has a high risk level due to the presence of severe security issues. The most severe issue is "Sensitive Data Exposure", which is classified as an Error. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, posing a significant risk to the project. 

3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If these issues are not addressed, they could lead to unauthorized access to customer data, which could have severe consequences including loss of customer trust and potential legal implications.

4. **Overall Issues**: The project has a variety of issues, including warnings for "Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)", "Insecure Cryptographic Storage", "Insufficient Transport Layer Protection", "Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards", "Insecure Use of Cryptography", and "Improper Certificate Validation". These issues indicate a lack of secure coding practices, which could lead to vulnerabilities in the software.

5. **Risk Assessment**: Given that all issues are found in a single file, the risk is concentrated. However, if this file is representative of the overall project, the risk is high. The fact that no files were found without issues is concerning and indicates a need for improved coding practices and potentially a review of the project's architecture.

Highlights:

- The project's single file, README.md, has a variety of severe security issues.
- The most severe issue, "Sensitive Data Exposure", could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- The presence of multiple warnings indicates a lack of secure coding practices.
- The potential customer impact of these issues is high, as they could lead to unauthorized access to customer data.
- The risk assessment for the project is high, given the concentration of issues in a single file and the absence of files without issues.

```

### Fedora

The package is maintained by the Fedora community. If you encounter issues related to the usage of the RPM, please use this [issue tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=chisel&list_id=11614537&product=Fedora&product=Fedora%20EPEL).

sudo dnf -y install chisel
```

### Source

```sh
$ go install github.com/jpillora/chisel@latest
```

## Demo

A [demo app](https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com) on Heroku is running this `chisel server`:

```sh
$ chisel server --port $PORT --proxy http://example.com
# listens on $PORT, proxy web requests to http://example.com
```

This demo app is also running a [simple file server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) on `:3000`, which is normally inaccessible due to Heroku's firewall. However, if we tunnel in with:

```sh
$ chisel client https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com 3000
# connects to chisel server at https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com,
# tunnels your localhost:3000 to the server's localhost:3000
```

and then visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), we should see a directory listing. Also, if we visit the [demo app](https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com) in the browser we should hit the server's default proxy and see a copy of [example.com](http://example.com).

<!--tmpl,code=plain:echo "$ chisel server --help" && go run main.go server --help | cat | sed 's#0.0.0-src (go1\..*)#X.Y.Z#' -->
``` plain 
$ chisel server --help

  Usage: chisel server [options]

  Options:

    --host, Defines the HTTP listening host – the network interface
    (defaults the environment variable HOST and falls back to 0.0.0.0).

    --port, -p, Defines the HTTP listening port (defaults to the environment
    variable PORT and fallsback to port 8080).

    --key, (deprecated use --keygen and --keyfile instead)
    An optional string to seed the generation of a ECDSA public
    and private key pair. All communications will be secured using this
    key pair. Share the subsequent fingerprint with clients to enable detection
    of man-in-the-middle attacks (defaults to the CHISEL_KEY environment
    variable, otherwise a new key is generate each run).

    --keygen, A path to write a newly generated PEM-encoded SSH private key file.
    If users depend on your --key fingerprint, you may also include your --key to
    output your existing key. Use - (dash) to output the generated key to stdout.

    --keyfile, An optional path to a PEM-encoded SSH private key. When
    this flag is set, the --key option is ignored, and the provided private key
    is used to secure all communications. (defaults to the CHISEL_KEY_FILE
    environment variable). Since ECDSA keys are short, you may also set keyfile
    to an inline base64 private key (e.g. chisel server --keygen - | base64).

    --authfile, An optional path to a users.json file. This file should
    be an object with users defined like:
      {
        "<user:pass>": ["<addr-regex>","<addr-regex>"]
      }

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 12:43:05 PM PDT

The code you've provided is not actually a piece of executable code, but rather a description and documentation of a project called Chisel, written in the Go programming language. It's a README file that typically exists in the root directory of a project repository.

Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. It's a single executable that includes both client and server. Its main use case is to pass through firewalls, but it can also be used to provide a secure endpoint into a network.

The README file provides some key features of Chisel:
- Encrypted connections using the SSH protocol (via `crypto/ssh`)
- Authenticated connections
- Client auto-reconnects with exponential backoff
- Clients can create multiple tunnel endpoints over one TCP connection
- Reverse port forwarding
- Server optionally doubles as a reverse proxy
- Server optionally allows SOCKS5 connections
- Clients optionally allow SOCKS5 connections from a reversed port forward
- Client connections over stdio which supports `ssh -o ProxyCommand` providing SSH over HTTP

It also provides installation instructions for different platforms (Binaries, Docker, Fedora, Source), a demo of how to use it, and usage instructions for both server and client modes.

Here are some links for further reading:
- [Chisel Github repository](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)
- [GoDoc for Chisel](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/chisel)
- [Exponential backoff](https://github.com/jpillora/backoff)
- [Reverse proxy in Go](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/#NewSingleHostReverseProxy)
- [SOCKS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS)

Since this is a README file, it doesn't directly implement any algorithms. However, the Chisel project itself likely uses various network communication and encryption algorithms to establish and secure its tunnels.

Sorry for the confusion, but the provided text does not seem to be a piece of source code. It appears to be a part of a software documentation or a comment in the code, explaining how a certain feature or functionality works.

From the text, it seems to be describing a process for user authentication and address verification in a system that supports remote connections and reverse port forwarding. Here's a breakdown:

1. When a user (`<user>`) connects, their password (`<pass>`) is verified.
2. The remote addresses are compared against a list of address regular expressions for a match.
3. The format of the addresses is either "<remote-host>:<remote-port>" for normal remotes or "R:<local-interface>:<local-port>" for reverse port forwarding remotes.
4. The file (presumably the one containing the list of address regular expressions) will be automatically reloaded if it changes.
5. The `--auth` is an optional string representing a single user with full access, in the form of `<user:pass>`. It is equivalent to creating an authfile with `{"<user:pass>": [""]}`. If unset, it will use the...

Unfortunately, the text cuts off there, so we can't see what it will use if `--auth` is unset.

However, without actual code, I can't provide a detailed analysis or discuss the algorithms used. If you have any source code related to this functionality, feel free to share it, and I'll be happy to analyze it for you.

### Boost Source-Level Security Analysis

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 12:47:24 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 9/10

   **Line Number**: 291

   **Bug Type**: Sensitive Data Exposure

   **Description**: The user's password is being handled in plain text, which is a major security risk. If intercepted, this could lead to unauthorized access to the user's account. More on this issue can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure

   **Solution**: Passwords should never be stored or transmitted in plain text. Consider using a secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or argon2. The hashed password should then be compared with the hashed version of the input password for verification. More on secure password handling can be found here: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html


2. **Severity**: 8/10

   **Line Number**: 295

   **Bug Type**: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

   **Description**: The software is using a user-provided string to reference objects directly, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access if a malicious user manipulates the string. More on this issue can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A4_2017-Insecure_Direct_Object_References

   **Solution**: Instead of using user-provided strings to reference objects directly, consider using indirect references. This can be done by mapping the user-provided string to an internal reference which is then used to access the object. More on preventing IDOR can be found here: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 12:50:59 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 8/10

   **Line Number**: 291

   **Bug Type**: Data Compliance

   **Description**: The system is storing user credentials (<user:pass>) in plain text. This is a violation of GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA as these regulations require that personal data, including passwords, be stored securely.

   **Solution**: Use secure methods such as hashing for storing passwords. Avoid storing passwords in plain text. For hashing, you can use algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt or Argon2.


2. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 286

   **Bug Type**: Data Compliance

   **Description**: The system does not seem to be encrypting the user data during transmission. This could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches, which violates GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA regulations.

   **Solution**: Implement encryption for all data transmitted over networks. You can use secure protocols like HTTPS and TLS for data transmission.





### Cell 2:
## Original Code:

### ./README.md line 154

```markdown
    environment variable AUTH.

    --keepalive, An optional keepalive interval. Since the underlying
    transport is HTTP, in many instances we'll be traversing through
    proxies, often these proxies will close idle connections. You must
    specify a time with a unit, for example '5s' or '2m'. Defaults
    to '25s' (set to 0s to disable).

    --backend, Specifies another HTTP server to proxy requests to when
    chisel receives a normal HTTP request. Useful for hiding chisel in
    plain sight.

    --socks5, Allow clients to access the internal SOCKS5 proxy. See
    chisel client --help for more information.

    --reverse, Allow clients to specify reverse port forwarding remotes
    in addition to normal remotes.

    --tls-key, Enables TLS and provides optional path to a PEM-encoded
    TLS private key. When this flag is set, you must also set --tls-cert,
    and you cannot set --tls-domain.

    --tls-cert, Enables TLS and provides optional path to a PEM-encoded
    TLS certificate. When this flag is set, you must also set --tls-key,
    and you cannot set --tls-domain.

    --tls-domain, Enables TLS and automatically acquires a TLS key and
    certificate using LetsEncrypt. Setting --tls-domain requires port 443.
    You may specify multiple --tls-domain flags to serve multiple domains.
    The resulting files are cached in the "$HOME/.cache/chisel" directory.
    You can modify this path by setting the CHISEL_LE_CACHE variable,
    or disable caching by setting this variable to "-". You can optionally
    provide a certificate notification email by setting CHISEL_LE_EMAIL.

    --tls-ca, a path to a PEM encoded CA certificate bundle or a directory
    holding multiple PEM encode CA certificate bundle files, which is used to 
    validate client connections. The provided CA certificates will be used 
    instead of the system roots. This is commonly used to implement mutual-TLS. 

    --pid Generate pid file in current working directory

    -v, Enable verbose logging

    --help, This help text

  Signals:
    The chisel process is listening for:
      a SIGUSR2 to print process stats, and

``` plain 
$ chisel client --help

  Usage: chisel client [options] <server> <remote> [remote] [remote] ...

  <server> is the URL to the chisel server.

  <remote>s are remote connections tunneled through the server, each of
  which come in the form:

    <local-host>:<local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port>/<protocol>

    ■ local-host defaults to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).
    ■ local-port defaults to remote-port.
    ■ remote-port is required*.
    ■ remote-host defaults to 0.0.0.0 (server localhost).
    ■ protocol defaults to tcp.

  which shares <remote-host>:<remote-port> from the server to the client
  as <local-host>:<local-port>, or:

    R:<local-interface>:<local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port>/<protocol>

  which does reverse port forwarding, sharing <remote-host>:<remote-port>
  from the client to the server's <local-interface>:<local-port>.

    example remotes

      3000
      example.com:3000
      3000:google.com:80
      192.168.0.5:3000:google.com:80
      socks
      5000:socks
      R:2222:localhost:22
      R:socks
      R:5000:socks
      stdio:example.com:22
      1.1.1.1:53/udp

    When the chisel server has --socks5 enabled, remotes can
    specify "socks" in place of remote-host and remote-port.
    The default local host and port for a "socks" remote is
    127.0.0.1:1080. Connections to this remote will terminate
    at the server's internal SOCKS5 proxy.

    When the chisel server has --reverse enabled, remotes can
    be prefixed with R to denote that they are reversed. That
    is, the server will listen and accept connections, and they
    will be proxied through the client which specified the remote.
    Reverse remotes specifying "R:socks" will listen on the server's
    default socks port (1080) and terminate the connection at the
    client's internal SOCKS5 proxy.

    When stdio is used as local-host, the tunnel will connect standard
    input/output of this program with the remote. This is useful when 
    combined with ssh ProxyCommand. You can use
      ssh -o ProxyCommand='chisel client chiselserver stdio:%h:%p' \
          user@example.com
    to connect to an SSH server through the tunnel.

  Options:

    --fingerprint, A *strongly recommended* fingerprint string
    to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.
 Fingerprint mismatches will close the connection.
 Fingerprints are generated by hashing the ECDSA public key using
 SHA256 and encoding the result in base64.
 Fingerprints must be 44 characters containing a trailing equals (=).

    --auth, An optional username and password (client authentication)
    in the form: "<user>:<pass>". These credentials are compared to
    the credentials inside the server's --authfile. defaults to the
    AUTH environment variable.

    --keepalive, An optional keepalive interval. Since the underlying
    transport is HTTP, in many instances we'll be traversing through
    proxies, often these proxies will close idle connections. You must
    specify a time with a unit, for example '5s' or '2m'. Defaults
    to '25s' (set to 0s to disable).

    --max-retry-count, Maximum number of times to retry before exiting.
    Defaults to unlimited.

    --max-retry-interval, Maximum wait time before retrying after a
    disconnection. Defaults to 5 minutes.

    --proxy, An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be
    used to reach the chisel server. Authentication can be specified
    inside the URL.
    For example, http://admin:password@my-server.com:8081
            or: socks://admin:password@my-server.com:1080

    --header, Set a custom header in the form "HeaderName: HeaderContent".
    Can be used multiple times. (e.g --header "Foo: Bar" --header "Hello: World")

    --hostname, Optionally set the 'Host' header (defaults to the host
    found in the server url).

    --sni, Override the ServerName when using TLS (defaults to the 
    hostname).

    --tls-ca, An optional root certificate bundle used to verify the
    chisel server. Only valid when connecting to the server with
    "https" or "wss". By default, the operating system CAs will be used.

    --tls-skip-verify, Skip server TLS certificate verification of
    chain and host name (if TLS is used for transport connections to
    server). If set, client accepts any TLS certificate presented by
    the server and any host name in that certificate. This only affects
    transport https (wss) connection. Chisel server's public key
    may be still verified (see --fingerprint) after inner connection
    is established.

    --tls-key, a path to a PEM encoded private key used for client 
    authentication (mutual-TLS).

    --tls-cert, a path to a PEM encoded certificate matching the provided 
    private key. The certificate must have client authentication 
    enabled (mutual-TLS).

    --pid Generate pid file in current working directory

    -v, Enable verbose logging

    --help, This help text

  Signals:
    The chisel process is listening for:
      a SIGUSR2 to print process stats, and
      a SIGHUP to short-circuit the client reconnect timer

  Version:
    X.Y.Z

### Security

Encryption is always enabled. When you start up a chisel server, it will generate an in-memory ECDSA public/private key pair. The public key fingerprint (base64 encoded SHA256) will be displayed as the server starts. Instead of generating a random key, the server may optionally specify a key file, using the `--keyfile` option. When clients connect, they will also display the server's public key fingerprint. The client can force a particular fingerprint using the `--fingerprint` option. See the `--help` above for more information.

### Authentication

Using the `--authfile` option, the server may optionally provide a `user.json` configuration file to create a list of accepted users. The client then authenticates using the `--auth` option. See [users.json](example/users.json) for an example authentication configuration file. See the `--help` above for more information.

Internally, this is done using the _Password_ authentication method provided by SSH. Learn more about `crypto/ssh` here http://blog.gopheracademy.com/go-and-ssh/.

### SOCKS5 Guide with Docker

1. Print a new private key to the terminal

    ```sh
    chisel server --keygen -
    # or save it to disk --keygen /path/to/mykey
    ```

1. Start your chisel server

    ```sh
    jpillora/chisel server --keyfile '<ck-base64 string or file path>' -p 9312 --socks5
    ```

1. Connect your chisel client (using server's fingerprint)

    ```sh
    chisel client --fingerprint '<see server output>' <server-address>:9312 socks
    ```

1. Point your SOCKS5 clients (e.g. OS/Browser) to:

    ```
    <client-address>:1080
    ```

1. Now you have an encrypted, authenticated SOCKS5 connection over HTTP


#### Caveats

Since WebSockets support is required:

- IaaS providers all will support WebSockets (unless an unsupporting HTTP proxy has been forced in front of you, in which case I'd argue that you've been downgraded to PaaS)
- PaaS providers vary in their support for WebSockets
  - Heroku has full support
  - Openshift has full support though connections are only accepted on ports 8443 and 8080
  - Google App Engine has **no** support (Track this on [their repo](https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2535))

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 12:44:48 PM PDT

The code you provided is the help documentation for a command-line tool called Chisel. Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP. It is written in Go programming language. Chisel is a tool for managing SSH-like tunnels, it's a single executable including both client and server. 

Let's break down the server and client commands:

### Server Command
The server command is used to start a Chisel server. It accepts several arguments like `--auth`, `--keepalive`, `--backend`, `--socks5`, `--reverse`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, `--tls-domain`, `--tls-ca`, `--pid`, `-v` and `--help`. 

- `--auth`: Specifies the authentication method for the server.
- `--keepalive`: Sets the keepalive interval.
- `--backend`: Specifies another HTTP server to proxy requests to when Chisel receives a normal HTTP request.
- `--socks5`: Allows clients to access the internal SOCKS5 proxy.
- `--reverse`: Allows clients to specify reverse port forwarding remotes in addition to normal remotes.
- `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, `--tls-domain`, `--tls-ca`: These flags are used to enable and configure TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- `--pid`: Generates pid file in the current working directory.
- `-v`: Enables verbose logging.
- `--help`: Displays the help text.

The server also listens for two signals `SIGUSR2` and `SIGHUP` to print process stats and to short-circuit the client reconnect timer respectively.

### Client Command
The client command is used to start a Chisel client. It also accepts several arguments like `--fingerprint`, `--auth`, `--keepalive`, `--max-retry-count`, `--max-retry-interval`, `--proxy`, `--header`, `--hostname`, `--sni`, `--tls-ca`, `--tls-skip-verify`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, `--pid`, `-v` and `--help`.

- `--fingerprint`: A strongly recommended fingerprint string to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.
- `--auth`: An optional username and password for client authentication.
- `--keepalive`: An optional keepalive interval.
- `--max-retry-count`, `--max-retry-interval`: These flags set the maximum number of times to retry before exiting and the maximum wait time before retrying after a disconnection.
- `--proxy`: An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be used to reach the Chisel server.
- `--header`: Sets a custom header.
- `--hostname`, `--sni`: These flags are used to optionally set the 'Host' header and override the ServerName when using TLS.
- `--tls-ca`, `--tls-skip-verify`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`: These flags are used to configure TLS.
- `--pid`: Generates pid file in the current working directory.
- `-v`: Enables verbose logging.
- `--help`: Displays the help text.

The client also listens for two signals `SIGUSR2` and `SIGHUP` to print process stats and to short-circuit the client reconnect timer respectively.

### Boost Source-Level Security Analysis

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 12:48:27 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 314

   **Bug Type**: Insecure Use of Cryptography

   **Description**: The code uses TLS for encryption but allows the use of self-signed certificates. This could potentially allow an attacker to use a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and possibly modify the data.

   **Solution**: Consider using certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). If self-signed certificates must be used, consider implementing a mechanism to securely distribute the public keys to the clients. For more information, see: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/TLS_Certificate_Pinning_Cheat_Sheet.html


2. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 319

   **Bug Type**: Improper Authentication

   **Description**: The code allows the use of the '--auth' option for client authentication, but it does not specify any mechanism for securely storing or transmitting these credentials. This could potentially expose sensitive information.

   **Solution**: Consider using secure methods for storing and transmitting authentication credentials, such as secure password hashing and encryption. For more information, see: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html


3. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 306

   **Bug Type**: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

   **Description**: The code allows the use of the '--pid' option to generate a PID file in the current working directory. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the PID file to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the service.

   **Solution**: Consider implementing a mechanism to protect the PID file, such as secure file permissions or storing the PID file in a secure directory. For more information, see: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html


4. **Severity**: 8/10

   **Line Number**: 314

   **Bug Type**: Improper Certificate Validation

   **Description**: The code allows the use of the '--tls-skip-verify' option, which skips the TLS certificate verification. This could potentially allow an attacker to use a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and possibly modify the data.

   **Solution**: Avoid using the '--tls-skip-verify' option. Always validate TLS certificates to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data. For more information, see: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/TLS_Certificate_Pinning_Cheat_Sheet.html
