### Boost Architectural Quick Summary Security Report

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 1:06:31 PM PDT

Executive Report:

1. **Architectural Impact**: The project's architecture appears to be well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns across different files and modules. However, there are several security issues that could potentially impact the integrity of the architecture. For instance, the use of insecure environment variables in 'main.go' could lead to unauthorized access if not properly secured. Similarly, the insecure default configuration in 'main.go' could unintentionally expose the server to untrusted networks. 

2. **Risk Analysis**: The project has a total of 62 files, with issues detected in only a few of them. However, the severity of these issues ranges from warnings to errors, with the most severe being 'Sensitive Data Exposure' in 'README.md'. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to user accounts if intercepted. The risk associated with these issues is high and could potentially impact the overall health of the project if not addressed promptly.

3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The identified issues could potentially impact the customers in terms of data security and privacy. For instance, the handling of user passwords in plain text in 'README.md' and 'main.go' could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts. This could result in a loss of trust among customers and potential reputational damage for the company.

4. **Overall Issues**: The project has several issues related to security, such as insecure file permissions, hard-coded file paths, and sensitive data exposure. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the project. 

Risk Assessment:

- Healthy Files: Out of the 62 files in the project, a significant number of them have no detected issues. This indicates a good level of code quality and adherence to best practices in a majority of the project.
  
- Files with Issues: A small percentage of the project files have issues, with the most severe being 'Sensitive Data Exposure' in 'README.md'. This indicates a need for improved security practices and potentially a review of the project's security architecture.

In conclusion, while the project's architecture is well-structured, there are several security issues that need to be addressed. The potential impact on customers and the overall health of the project is significant, and immediate action is required to mitigate these risks.

### Boost Architectural Quick Summary Performance Report

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 1:07:12 PM PDT

Executive Level Report:

1. **Architectural Impact**: The most severe issues are found in the "main.go" file, which is typically the entry point of the software. This could potentially impact the overall architecture of the software, as any issues in the main file can propagate to other parts of the software. The issues are mainly related to CPU and Memory usage, which are critical for the performance and efficiency of the software.

2. **Risk Analysis**: Out of the 62 files in the project, issues have been detected in only 4 files, which is approximately 6.5% of the total files. This is a relatively low percentage, indicating a low risk level. However, the severity of the issues in these files is high, which increases the risk. The issues are mainly related to CPU and Memory usage, which can lead to performance degradation and inefficient resource utilization.

3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The issues detected can lead to performance degradation, which can impact the user experience. In particular, the issue in the "main.go" file related to the generation of a PID file can be CPU intensive if the function is called frequently. This can slow down the software, leading to a poor user experience.

4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project source is good, with issues detected in only 6.5% of the files. However, the severity of the issues is high, which needs to be addressed to ensure the quality and performance of the software.

5. **Risk Assessment**: The overall risk is low, given the low percentage of files with issues. However, the high severity of the issues increases the risk. It is recommended to address these issues to ensure the quality and performance of the software.

Highlights:

- The most severe issues are found in the "main.go" file, which can impact the overall architecture and performance of the software.
- Issues have been detected in only 4 out of 62 files, indicating a low risk level.
- The issues detected can lead to performance degradation, impacting the user experience.
- The overall health of the project source is good, with issues detected in only 6.5% of the files.
- The high severity of the issues increases the risk, and it is recommended to address these issues to ensure the quality and performance of the software.

### Boost Architectural Quick Summary Compliance Report

Last Updated: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 at 1:08:09 PM PDT

Executive Level Report:

1. **Architectural Impact**: The architectural impact of the issues found is significant. The main.go file, which is likely the entry point of the application, has multiple severe issues related to data privacy and compliance. This suggests that the application's architecture does not adequately consider secure data handling and transmission. The Dockerfile also has issues, indicating potential problems with the application's deployment environment.

2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with these issues is high. Violations of data compliance standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR can lead to legal penalties and reputational damage. The fact that these issues are present in multiple files suggests that they are systemic, rather than isolated incidents.

3. **Potential Customer Impact**: Customers could be directly affected by these issues. Insecure handling of user credentials could lead to data breaches, resulting in loss of trust and potential legal action from customers. Inadequate encryption of data in transit could expose sensitive customer information to unauthorized parties.

4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project is concerning. Out of 62 files, 7 files have been identified with issues, which is approximately 11% of the total files. This is a significant proportion, especially considering that these files include main.go and Dockerfile, which are critical to the application's operation and deployment.

Highlights of the Analysis:

1. **Data Compliance Violations**: The main.go file has been flagged for storing user credentials in a file (users.json), which is a violation of PCI DSS and HIPAA. This could lead to insecure storage of cardholder data or unauthorized access to Protected Health Information (PHI).

2. **Inadequate Data Encryption**: The main.go file does not implement any form of encryption for data in transit, which is a requirement of HIPAA. This could expose sensitive customer information during transmission over networks.

3. **Insecure Data Transmission**: The application allows username and password to be transmitted, potentially without encryption. This could be a violation of PCI DSS and could lead to unauthorized access if the data is breached.

4. **Potential Exposure of Sensitive Data**: The README.md file uses a custom header which can potentially expose sensitive cardholder data. This is a violation of PCI DSS.

5. **Insecure Storage of User Credentials**: The README.md file indicates that the code uses a user.json file for storing user credentials, which is a violation of GDPR. This could lead to unauthorized access if the data is breached.
