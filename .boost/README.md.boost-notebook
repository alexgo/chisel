It's a README file that typically exists in the root directory of a project repository.\n\nChisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. It's a single executable that includes both client and server. Its main use case is to pass through firewalls, but it can also be used to provide a secure endpoint into a network.\n\nThe README file provides some key features of Chisel:\n- Encrypted connections using the SSH protocol (via `crypto/ssh`)\n- Authenticated connections\n- Client auto-reconnects with exponential backoff\n- Clients can create multiple tunnel endpoints over one TCP connection\n- Reverse port forwarding\n- Server optionally doubles as a reverse proxy\n- Server optionally allows SOCKS5 connections\n- Clients optionally allow SOCKS5 connections from a reversed port forward\n- Client connections over stdio which supports `ssh -o ProxyCommand` providing SSH over HTTP\n\nIt also provides installation instructions for different platforms (Binaries, Docker, Fedora, Source), a demo of how to use it, and usage instructions for both server and client modes.\n\nHere are some links for further reading:\n- [Chisel Github repository](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)\n- [GoDoc for Chisel](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/chisel)\n- [Exponential backoff](https://github.com/jpillora/backoff)\n- [Reverse proxy in Go](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/#NewSingleHostReverseProxy)\n- [SOCKS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS)\n\nSince this is a README file, it doesn't directly implement any algorithms. However, the Chisel project itself likely uses various network communication and encryption algorithms to establish and secure its tunnels."

Share the subsequent fingerprint with clients to enable detection\n    of man-in-the-middle attacks (defaults to the CHISEL_KEY environment\n    variable, otherwise a new key is generate each run).\n\n    --keygen, A path to write a newly generated PEM-encoded SSH private key file.\n    If users depend on your --key fingerprint, you may also include your --key to\n    output your existing key. Use - (dash) to output the generated key to stdout.\n\n    --keyfile, An optional path to a PEM-encoded SSH private key. When\n    this flag is set, the --key option is ignored, and the provided private key\n    is used to secure all communications. (defaults to the CHISEL_KEY_FILE\n    environment variable). Since ECDSA keys are short, you may also set keyfile\n    to an inline base64 private key (e.g. chisel server --keygen - | base64).\n\n    --authfile, An optional path to a users.json file.

It appears to be a part of a software documentation or a comment in the code, explaining how a certain feature or functionality works.\n\nFrom the text, it seems to be describing a process for user authentication and address verification in a system that supports remote connections and reverse port forwarding. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. When a user (`<user>`) connects, their password (`<pass>`) is verified.\n2. The remote addresses are compared against a list of address regular expressions for a match.\n3. The format of the addresses is either \"<remote-host>:<remote-port>\" for normal remotes or \"R:<local-interface>:<local-port>\" for reverse port forwarding remotes.\n4. The file (presumably the one containing the list of address regular expressions) will be automatically reloaded if it changes.\n5. The `--auth` is an optional string representing a single user with full access, in the form of `<user:pass>`. It is equivalent to creating an authfile with `{\"<user:pass>\": [\"\"]}`. If unset, it will use the...\n\nUnfortunately, the text cuts off there, so we can't see what it will use if `--auth` is unset.\n\nHowever, without actual code, I can't provide a detailed analysis or discuss the algorithms used. If you have any source code related to this functionality, feel free to share it, and I'll be happy to analyze it for you."

If intercepted, this could lead to unauthorized access to the user's account. More on this issue can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\n\n   **Solution**: Passwords should never be stored or transmitted in plain text. Consider using a secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or argon2. The hashed password should then be compared with the hashed version of the input password for verification.

Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP. It is written in Go programming language. Chisel is a tool for managing SSH-like tunnels, it's a single executable including both client and server. \n\nLet's break down the server and client commands:\n\n### Server Command\nThe server command is used to start a Chisel server. It accepts several arguments like `--auth`, `--keepalive`, `--backend`, `--socks5`, `--reverse`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, `--tls-domain`, `--tls-ca`, `--pid`, `-v` and `--help`. \n\n- `--auth`: Specifies the authentication method for the server.\n- `--keepalive`: Sets the keepalive interval.\n- `--backend`: Specifies another HTTP server to proxy requests to when Chisel receives a normal HTTP request.\n- `--socks5`: Allows clients to access the internal SOCKS5 proxy.\n- `--reverse`: Allows clients to specify reverse port forwarding remotes in addition to normal remotes.\n- `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, `--tls-domain`, `--tls-ca`: These flags are used to enable and configure TLS (Transport Layer Security).\n- `--pid`: Generates pid file in the current working directory.\n- `-v`: Enables verbose logging.\n- `--help`: Displays the help text.\n\nThe server also listens for two signals `SIGUSR2` and `SIGHUP` to print process stats and to short-circuit the client reconnect timer respectively.\n\n### Client Command\nThe client command is used to start a Chisel client. It also accepts several arguments like `--fingerprint`, `--auth`, `--keepalive`, `--max-retry-count`, `--max-retry-interval`, `--proxy`, `--header`, `--hostname`, `--sni`, `--tls-ca`, `--tls-skip-verify`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, `--pid`, `-v` and `--help`.\n\n- `--fingerprint`: A strongly recommended fingerprint string to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.\n- `--auth`: An optional username and password for client authentication.\n- `--keepalive`: An optional keepalive interval.\n- `--max-retry-count`, `--max-retry-interval`: These flags set the maximum number of times to retry before exiting and the maximum wait time before retrying after a disconnection.\n- `--proxy`: An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be used to reach the Chisel server.\n- `--header`: Sets a custom header.\n- `--hostname`, `--sni`: These flags are used to optionally set the 'Host' header and override the ServerName when using TLS.\n- `--tls-ca`, `--tls-skip-verify`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`: These flags are used to configure TLS.\n- `--pid`: Generates pid file in the current working directory.\n- `-v`: Enables verbose logging.\n- `--help`: Displays the help text.\n\nThe client also listens for two signals `SIGUSR2` and `SIGHUP` to print process stats and to short-circuit the client reconnect timer respectively.\n\nYou can learn more about Chisel from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)."

Setting --tls-domain requires port 443.\n    You may specify multiple --tls-domain flags to serve multiple domains.\n    The resulting files are cached in the \"$HOME/.cache/chisel\" directory.\n    You can modify this path by setting the CHISEL_LE_CACHE variable,\n    or disable caching by setting this variable to \"-\". You can optionally\n    provide a certificate notification email by setting CHISEL_LE_EMAIL.\n\n    --tls-ca, a path to a PEM encoded CA certificate bundle or a directory\n    holding multiple PEM encode CA certificate bundle files, which is used to \n    validate client connections. The provided CA certificates will be used \n    instead of the system roots. This is commonly used to implement mutual-TLS. \n\n    --pid Generate pid file in current working directory\n\n    -v, Enable verbose logging\n\n    --help, This help text\n\n  Signals:\n    The chisel process is listening for:\n      a SIGUSR2 to print process stats, and\n      a SIGHUP to short-circuit the client reconnect timer\n\n  Version:\n    X.Y.Z\n\n  Read more:\n    https://github.com/jpillora/chisel\n\n```\n<!--/tmpl-->\n\n\n<!--tmpl,code=plain:echo \"$ chisel client --help\" && go run main.go client --help | sed 's#0.0.0-src (go1\\..*)#X.Y.Z#' -->\n``` plain \n$ chisel client --help\n\n  Usage: chisel client [options] <server> <remote> [remote] [remote] ...\n\n  <server> is the URL to the chisel server.\n\n  <remote>s are remote connections tunneled through the server, each of\n  which come in the form:\n\n    <local-host>:<local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port>/<protocol>\n\n    ■ local-host defaults to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).\n    ■ local-port defaults to remote-port.\n    ■ remote-port is required*.\n    ■ remote-host defaults to 0.0.0.0 (server localhost).\n    ■ protocol defaults to tcp.\n\n  which shares <remote-host>:<remote-port> from the server to the client\n  as <local-host>:<local-port>, or:\n\n    R:<local-interface>:<local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port>/<protocol>\n\n  which does reverse port forwarding, sharing <remote-host>:<remote-port>\n  from the client to the server's <local-interface>:<local-port>.\n\n    example remotes\n\n      3000\n      example.com:3000\n      3000:google.com:80\n      192.168.0.5:3000:google.com:80\n      socks\n      5000:socks\n      R:2222:localhost:22\n      R:socks\n      R:5000:socks\n      stdio:example.com:22\n      1.1.1.1:53/udp\n\n    When the chisel server has --socks5 enabled, remotes can\n    specify \"socks\" in place of remote-host and remote-port.\n    The default local host and port for a \"socks\" remote is\n    127.0.0.1:1080. Connections to this remote will terminate\n    at the server's internal SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n    When the chisel server has --reverse enabled, remotes can\n    be prefixed with R to denote that they are reversed. That\n    is, the server will listen and accept connections, and they\n    will be proxied through the client which specified the remote.\n    Reverse remotes specifying \"R:socks\" will listen on the server's\n    default socks port (1080) and terminate the connection at the\n    client's internal SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n    When stdio is used as local-host, the tunnel will connect standard\n    input/output of this program with the remote. This is useful when \n    combined with ssh ProxyCommand. You can use\n      ssh -o ProxyCommand='chisel client chiselserver stdio:%h:%p' \\\n          user@example.com\n    to connect to an SSH server through the tunnel.\n\n  Options:\n\n    --fingerprint, A *strongly recommended* fingerprint string\n    to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.\n\tFingerprint mismatches will close the connection.\n\tFingerprints are generated by hashing the ECDSA public key using\n\tSHA256 and encoding the result in base64.\n\tFingerprints must be 44 characters containing a trailing equals (=).\n\n    --auth, An optional username and password (client authentication)\n    in the form: \"<user>:<pass>\". These credentials are compared to\n    the credentials inside the server's --authfile. defaults to the\n    AUTH environment variable.\n\n    --keepalive, An optional keepalive interval. Since the underlying\n    transport is HTTP, in many instances we'll be traversing through\n    proxies, often these proxies will close idle connections. You must\n    specify a time with a unit, for example '5s' or '2m'. Defaults\n    to '25s' (set to 0s to disable).\n\n    --max-retry-count, Maximum number of times to retry before exiting.\n    Defaults to unlimited.\n\n    --max-retry-interval, Maximum wait time before retrying after a\n    disconnection. Defaults to 5 minutes.\n\n    --proxy, An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be\n    used to reach the chisel server. Authentication can be specified\n    inside the URL.\n    For example, http://admin:password@my-server.com:8081\n            or: socks://admin:password@my-server.com:1080\n\n    --header, Set a custom header in the form \"HeaderName: HeaderContent\".\n    Can be used multiple times. (e.g --header \"Foo: Bar\" --header \"Hello: World\")\n\n    --hostname, Optionally set the 'Host' header (defaults to the host\n    found in the server url).\n\n    --sni, Override the ServerName when using TLS (defaults to the \n    hostname).\n\n    --tls-ca, An optional root certificate bundle used to verify the\n    chisel server. Only valid when connecting to the server with\n    \"https\" or \"wss\". By default, the operating system CAs will be used.\n\n    --tls-skip-verify, Skip server TLS certificate verification of\n    chain and host name (if TLS is used for transport connections to\n    server). If set, client accepts any TLS certificate presented by\n    the server and any host name in that certificate. This only affects\n    transport https (wss) connection. Chisel server's public key\n    may be still verified (see --fingerprint) after inner connection\n    is established.\n\n    --tls-key, a path to a PEM encoded private key used for client \n    authentication (mutual-TLS).\n\n    --tls-cert, a path to a PEM encoded certificate matching the provided \n    private key. The certificate must have client authentication \n    enabled (mutual-TLS).\n\n    --pid Generate pid file in current working directory\n\n    -v, Enable verbose logging\n\n    --help, This help text\n\n  Signals:\n    The chisel process is listening for:\n      a SIGUSR2 to print process stats, and\n      a SIGHUP to short-circuit the client reconnect timer\n\n  Version:\n    X.Y.Z\n\n  Read more:\n    https://github.com/jpillora/chisel\n\n```\n<!--/tmpl-->\n\n### Security\n\nEncryption is always enabled. When you start up a chisel server, it will generate an in-memory ECDSA public/private key pair. The public key fingerprint (base64 encoded SHA256) will be displayed as the server starts. Instead of generating a random key, the server may optionally specify a key file, using the `--keyfile` option. When clients connect, they will also display the server's public key fingerprint. The client can force a particular fingerprint using the `--fingerprint` option. See the `--help` above for more information.\n\n### Authentication\n\nUsing the `--authfile` option, the server may optionally provide a `user.json` configuration file to create a list of accepted users. The client then authenticates using the `--auth` option. See [users.json](example/users.json) for an example authentication configuration file. See the `--help` above for more information.\n\nInternally, this is done using the _Password_ authentication method provided by SSH. Learn more about `crypto/ssh` here http://blog.gopheracademy.com/go-and-ssh/.\n\n### SOCKS5 Guide with Docker\n\n1. Print a new private key to the terminal\n\n    ```sh\n    chisel server --keygen -\n    # or save it to disk --keygen /path/to/mykey\n    ```\n\n1. Start your chisel server\n\n    ```sh\n    jpillora/chisel server --keyfile '<ck-base64 string or file path>' -p 9312 --socks5\n    ```\n\n1. Connect your chisel client (using server's fingerprint)\n\n    ```sh\n    chisel client --fingerprint '<see server output>' <server-address>:9312 socks\n    ```\n\n1. Point your SOCKS5 clients (e.g. OS/Browser) to:\n\n    ```\n    <client-address>:1080\n    ```\n\n1. Now you have an encrypted, authenticated SOCKS5 connection over HTTP\n\n\n#### Caveats\n\nSince WebSockets support is required:\n\n- IaaS providers all will support WebSockets (unless an unsupporting HTTP proxy has been forced in front of you, in which case I'd argue that you've been downgraded to PaaS)\n- PaaS providers vary in their support for WebSockets\n  - Heroku has full support\n  - Openshift has full support though connections are only accepted on ports 8443 and 8080\n  - Google App Engine has **no** support (Track this on [their repo](https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2535))\n\n## Contributing\n\n- http://golang.org/doc/code.html\n- http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html\n- `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share` contains the shared package\n- `github.com/jpillora/chisel/server` contains the server package\n- `github.com/jpillora/chisel/client` contains the client package\n\n## Changelog\n\n- `1.0` - Initial release\n- `1.1` - Replaced simple symmetric encryption for ECDSA SSH\n- `1.2` - Added SOCKS5 (server) and HTTP CONNECT (client) support\n- `1.3` - Added reverse tunnelling support\n- `1.4` - Added arbitrary HTTP header support\n- `1.5` - Added reverse SOCKS support (by @aus)\n- `1.6` - Added client stdio support (by @BoleynSu)\n- `1.7` - Added UDP support\n- `1.8` - Move to a `scratch`Docker image\n- `1.9` - Switch from `--key` seed to P256 key strings with `--key{gen,file}` + bump to Go 1.21 (by @cmenginnz)\n",
