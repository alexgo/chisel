SOCKS5 is a protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server.\n- `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share/cio`, `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share/cnet`, `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share/settings`: These are packages from the Chisel project itself. The `cio` package likely provides logging functionality, `cnet` probably contains network utilities, and `settings` likely contains configuration settings for the project.\n- `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`: This is an SSH package from the Go crypto library. SSH is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.\n- `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`: This package provides synchronization, error propagation, and Context cancelation for groups of goroutines.\n\nThe `Config` struct defined in this package represents the configuration for a network tunnel. The struct fields are:\n\n- `*cio.Logger`: This is an embedded field of type `*cio.Logger`, which likely represents a logger for logging information about the tunnel's operation.\n- `Inbound`, `Outbound`: These boolean fields likely indicate whether the tunnel supports inbound and outbound connections respectively.\n- `Socks`: This boolean field likely indicates whether the tunnel supports the SOCKS5 protocol.\n- `KeepAlive`: This field of type `time.Duration` likely represents the keep-alive interval for the tunnel. If no data is sent over the tunnel for this duration, a keep-alive message will be sent to maintain the connection.\n\nThe code doesn't seem to conflict with any architectural guidelines since none were provided. It follows standard Go idioms and conventions, and uses appropriate packages for creating a network tunnel.\n\nFor more information about the packages used, you can refer to their documentation:\n\n- [Go standard library](https://golang.org/pkg/)\n- [go-socks5](https://github.com/armon/go-socks5)\n- [golang.org/x/crypto/ssh](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh)\n- [golang.org/x/sync/errgroup](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup)"

This structure is used by both the client and the server in the Chisel software, which is a command-line tool for creating secure tunnels.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- `Config`: This is an embedded type within the `Tunnel` struct. It likely contains some configuration details for the tunnel. The actual fields of this struct are not provided in the code snippet.\n\n- `activeConnMut sync.RWMutex`: This is a read-write mutex which is used to ensure that only one goroutine can modify `activeConn` at a time. Other goroutines can read `activeConn` concurrently.\n\n- `activatingConn waitGroup`: This is a wait group that is used to ensure that all goroutines that are setting up the connection have finished before the tunnel is used.\n\n- `activeConn ssh.Conn`: This represents the active SSH connection of the tunnel.\n\n- `proxyCount int`: This is a counter for the number of proxies that are associated with the tunnel.\n\n- `connStats cnet.ConnCount`: This likely represents some statistics about the connections made through the tunnel.\n\n- `socksServer *socks5.Server`: This is a pointer to a SOCKS5 server. SOCKS5 is a protocol that is used for proxying data.\n\nThe comment above the struct definition explains the purpose of the `Tunnel` struct. It is used by both the client and the server side of the Chisel software. The client has a single set of remotes, whereas the server has multiple sets of remotes (one set per client). Each remote has a 1:1 mapping to a proxy. The proxies listen for data, send the data over the SSH connection, and the other end of the SSH connection communicates with the endpoint and returns the response.\n\nThis code is a part of a larger system and the complete functionality can only be understood by looking at the rest of the codebase. However, based on the provided snippet, it appears to follow good Go practices and seems to be well-organized and documented.\n\nFor more information about Go's struct, you can refer to this link: [Go by Example: Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)\n\nFor more information about SSH, you can refer to this link: [SSH (Secure Shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell))\n\nFor more information about SOCKS5, you can refer to this link: [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS)"

The `Fork` method typically creates a new logger that inherits the settings of the parent logger, but with a new name, in this case \"tun\". \n\n3. `t := &Tunnel{ Config: c, }`: Here, a new instance of `Tunnel` is created with the configuration `c`, and the address of this instance is assigned to `t`.\n\n4. `t.activatingConn.Add(1)`: This line is incrementing a counter in the `activatingConn` field of the `Tunnel` struct. This is typically used for synchronization purposes, like in a `sync.WaitGroup`.\n\n5. The following block of code is setting up a SOCKS server. SOCKS is a protocol for handling TCP traffic through a proxy server. It's not actually listening on any port at this point. \n\n6. `if c.Socks {`: This checks if the `Socks` field in the configuration is enabled.\n\n7. `sl := log.New(ioutil.Discard, \"\", 0)`: This creates a new logger that discards all log messages. `ioutil.Discard` is an `io.Writer` on which all `Write` calls succeed without doing anything.\n\n8. `if t.Logger.Debug { sl = log.New(os.Stdout, \"[socks]\", log.Ldate|log.Ltime) }`: If debug logging is enabled, it replaces the logger with one that writes to standard output and prefixes each log message with \"[socks]\". `log.Ldate|log.Ltime` are flags that tell the logger to include the date and time in log messages.\n\n9. `t.socksServer, _ = socks5.New(&socks5.Config{Logger: sl})`: This creates a new SOCKS5 server with the logger and assigns it to the `socksServer` field of the `Tunnel` struct. The second value returned by `socks5.New` is ignored with `_`.\n\n10. `extra += \" (SOCKS enabled)\"`: This appends \" (SOCKS enabled)\" to the `extra` string.\n\n11. `t.Debugf(\"Created%s\", extra)`: This logs a debug message indicating that the `Tunnel` has been created, along with the contents of the `extra` string.\n\n12. `return t`: The function finally returns the pointer to the newly created `Tunnel` instance.\n\nFor more about the SOCKS protocol, you can refer to [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS). For more about the Go standard library's log package, you can refer to [this link](https://golang.org/pkg/log/)."

The function takes four parameters: `ctx` of type `Context`, `c` of type `ssh.Conn`, `reqs` which is a receive-only channel of pointers to `ssh.Request`, and `chans` which is a receive-only channel of `ssh.NewChannel`.\n\nHere is a line-by-line explanation of the function:\n\n1. A goroutine is created that waits for the context `ctx` to be done. If the context is done, it will close the SSH connection and log a debug message. It also marks all connections as done in `activatingConn`.\n\n2. It acquires a lock on `activeConnMut` to prevent race conditions when accessing `activeConn`. If there's already an active connection, the function panics with the message \"double bind ssh\". If there's no active connection, the SSH connection `c` is set as the active connection. The lock is then released.\n\n3. It checks if the `KeepAlive` configuration is greater than 0. If it is, it starts a goroutine that continuously sends keepalive messages to the SSH server to keep the connection alive.\n\n4. It starts two goroutines to handle SSH requests and channels. These goroutines run concurrently and independently of the main function.\n\n5. It logs a debug message \"SSH connected\" and then waits for the SSH connection to close. The `Wait` method blocks until the SSH connection is closed, either by an error or by the server.\n\n6. When the SSH connection is closed, it logs a debug message \"SSH disconnected\". It then increments the counter in `activatingConn` by 1 and sets the active connection to nil, effectively marking the connection as inactive.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the error returned by the `Wait` function.\n\nThe function uses the Go language's concurrency features (goroutines and channels) to handle multiple SSH requests and channels simultaneously. It also uses the `sync` package's `Mutex` to prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources. The function follows the Go language's error handling conventions by returning errors to the caller.\n\nFor more information on Go's concurrency features, you can check out this link: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1\n\nFor more information on the `sync` package and `Mutex`, you can check out this link: https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Mutex\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can check out this link: https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go"

Secure Shell is a protocol that provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture.\n\nThe function takes a `context.Context` as an argument, which is a mechanism that allows you to manage long-running processes, especially in terms of cancellation, timeouts, and passing request-scoped data.\n\nHere's a line by line explanation of what the function does:\n\n1. `if isDone(ctx)`: This line checks if the context has been cancelled or done. If it's done, the function returns `nil`.\n\n2. `t.activeConnMut.RLock()`: This line acquires a read lock on `activeConnMut` mutex. This is to ensure thread-safety while reading the `activeConn` field of the `Tunnel` struct.\n\n3. `c := t.activeConn`: This line reads the `activeConn` field of the `Tunnel` struct into a local variable `c`.\n\n4. `t.activeConnMut.RUnlock()`: This line releases the read lock on `activeConnMut` mutex.\n\n5. `if c != nil`: This line checks if `c` is not `nil`, meaning there's an active connection already. If there's an active connection, the function returns `c`.\n\n6. `select` statement: This is used to wait for multiple channel operations. The `select` statement blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.\n\n   - `case <-ctx.Done()`: This case is selected if the context has been cancelled or done. If this case is selected, the function returns `nil`.\n\n   - `case <-time.After(settings.EnvDuration(\"SSH_WAIT\", 35*time.Second))`: This case is selected if no other cases are ready within the specified timeout duration. The duration is fetched from the environment variable \"SSH_WAIT\" and defaults to 35 seconds if it's not set. If this case is selected, the function returns `nil`.\n\n   - `case <-t.activatingConnWait()`: This case is selected when the `activatingConnWait` function signals that a new connection is being activated. If this case is selected, the function re-reads the `activeConn` field and returns it.\n\nThis function doesn't use any specific algorithm, but it uses a pattern commonly used in Go for managing and controlling long-running processes, using context and channels. \n\nYou can learn more about context, channels, and select statement in Go from the official Go documentation:\n- Context: https://golang.org/pkg/context/\n- Channels: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2\n- Select statement: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/5"

It waits for one of three events to occur: the context is cancelled (`ctxDone`), a timeout occurs (`timeAfter`), or the `activatingConnWait` channel is triggered. \n\nIf the context is cancelled, the function returns `nil` (`returnCancelled`). If a timeout occurs, the function also returns `nil` (`returnTimeout`). If the `activatingConnWait` channel is triggered, the function acquires a read lock on `activeConnMut` again and returns the existing connection (`returnConnected`).\n\nThis control flow diagram represents the primary path through the code, where the context is not cancelled and `activeConn` is not already set."

The function is a method of a `Tunnel` struct, and it's named `activatingConnWait`. It doesn't take any parameters other than the implicit `Tunnel` receiver, and it returns a receive-only channel of empty structs.\n\nLet's break down what the function does:\n\n1. It creates a new channel of empty structs: `ch := make(chan struct{})`. Channels are a way to communicate between different goroutines (concurrent threads) in Go. This channel will be used to signal when a certain operation has finished.\n\n2. It starts a new goroutine with `go func() {...}`. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.\n\n3. Inside this goroutine, it calls `t.activatingConn.Wait()`. This implies that `t.activatingConn` is of type `sync.WaitGroup`. A `WaitGroup` is a means of waiting for a collection of goroutines to finish executing. The `Wait()` method blocks until the `WaitGroup` counter is zero.\n\n4. After the `Wait()` call returns, it closes the channel `ch` with `close(ch)`. Closing a channel in Go is a signal that no more data will be sent on this channel. This is often used to signal completion to channel receivers.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the channel `ch`. The return type is `<-chan struct{}`, which is a receive-only channel of empty structs. This means that callers can only read from the returned channel, not write to it.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this function uses concurrency mechanisms provided by Go, specifically goroutines, channels, and `sync.WaitGroup`. These are fundamental to writing concurrent code in Go and allow different parts of the program to execute independently and communicate safely.\n\nFor more information about these concepts, you can refer to the official Go documentation:\n- Goroutines: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1\n- Channels: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2\n- `sync.WaitGroup`: https://pkg.go.dev/sync#WaitGroup\n\nAs for architectural guidelines, this function appears to follow good practices for concurrent programming in Go. It uses channels to communicate between goroutines and `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for goroutines to finish, both of which are recommended practices. Without knowing more about the larger system, it's hard to say whether there are any conflicts with overall architectural guidelines or constraints."

The Tunnel struct seems to represent a tunnel for network connections, and this function, `BindRemotes`, is used to convert remote settings into proxies and bind them to the tunnel. It blocks until the provided context is cancelled or there is an error in the proxies.\n\nThe function signature is `func (t *Tunnel) BindRemotes(ctx context.Context, remotes []*settings.Remote) error`, which means it is a method of the `Tunnel` struct, takes a context and a slice of pointers to `Remote` objects, and returns an error.\n\nThe function first checks if the `remotes` slice is empty and if the tunnel is not inbound. If either of these conditions is true, it returns an error.\n\nThen, it creates a slice of `Proxy` pointers with the same length as `remotes`. It iterates over `remotes` and for each `remote`, it creates a new `Proxy` using the `NewProxy` function, passing the tunnel's logger, the tunnel itself, the current proxy count, and the `remote`. If there's an error creating the proxy, it returns the error. Otherwise, it adds the proxy to the `proxies` slice and increments the proxy count.\n\nAn error group (`eg`) is then created from the provided context. This is a concurrency pattern in Go that makes it easier to manage and synchronize multiple goroutines that can error out. For each `proxy` in `proxies`, a new goroutine is created in the error group that runs the `Run` method of the `proxy`, passing the context.\n\nAfter starting all the goroutines, it logs that the proxies are bound and waits for all the goroutines to finish by calling `eg.Wait()`. If any of the goroutines returns an error, `eg.Wait()` will return that error. After the wait, it logs that the proxies are unbound and returns any error that occurred.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a form of the Fan-Out, Fan-In concurrency pattern in Go, where multiple goroutines are started (fan-out), and their results are collected into a single result (fan-in). The error group simplifies this pattern by providing built-in error handling and synchronization.\n\nFor more information about the error group package in Go, you can visit the official Go documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup. For more information about the Fan-Out, Fan-In pattern, you can read this blog post: https://blog.golang.org/pipelines."

This method is used to maintain an active SSH (Secure Shell) connection by periodically sending a \"ping\" request to the server and expecting a \"pong\" response. \n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `func (t *Tunnel) keepAliveLoop(sshConn ssh.Conn)`: This defines a method named `keepAliveLoop` on a `Tunnel` struct. The method takes an `ssh.Conn` type parameter, which is an SSH connection.\n\n2. `for { ... }`: This is an infinite loop that will continue until explicitly broken.\n\n3. `time.Sleep(t.Config.KeepAlive)`: The method sleeps for a duration specified by `t.Config.KeepAlive`. This is likely a configuration setting for the duration between each \"ping\" request.\n\n4. `_, b, err := sshConn.SendRequest(\"ping\", true, nil)`: The method sends a \"ping\" request to the server over the SSH connection. The `SendRequest` method returns three values: a boolean indicating whether the request was accepted, a byte slice containing the response, and an error if one occurred.\n\n5. `if err != nil { break }`: If there is an error in sending the request, the infinite loop is broken, effectively ending the keep-alive process.\n\n6. `if len(b) > 0 && !bytes.Equal(b, []byte(\"pong\")) { ... }`: The method checks if the response is not empty and not equal to \"pong\". If this condition is true, it logs a debug message saying \"strange ping response\" and breaks the loop.\n\n7. `sshConn.Close()`: If the loop is broken due to an error or an unexpected response, the SSH connection is closed.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple keep-alive mechanism for an SSH connection. It periodically sends a \"ping\" request to the server and expects a \"pong\" response. If it doesn't receive the expected response or encounters an error, it closes the connection.\n\nFor more information and background on Go and SSH, you can refer to the following resources:\n- Go Documentation: https://golang.org/doc/\n- Go SSH package documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\n- SSH Protocol: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251\n- Keep-Alive Mechanism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, the code seems to follow standard practices for maintaining an SSH connection in Go and does not appear to conflict with any general architectural guidelines. However, the specific details would depend on the broader context of the `Tunnel` struct and its usage within the project."

The primary path is represented by the green arrows, while the error path is represented by the red arrows.\n\nThe function starts at the \"Start\" node and then goes through a loop. Inside the loop, it sleeps for a certain duration specified by `t.Config.KeepAlive`. Then, it sends a \"ping\" request using the `sshConn` connection. If there is an error sending the request, it breaks out of the loop and goes to the \"End\" node.\n\nIf the request is sent successfully, it checks the response. If the response is not equal to \"pong\", it logs a message and breaks out of the loop, going to the \"End\" node.\n\nIf the response is equal to \"pong\", the loop continues and repeats the process.\n\nFinally, when the loop is broken, the `sshConn` connection is closed and the function ends at the \"End\" node."

An attacker could potentially intercept the communication and send a 'pong' response, leading to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.\n\n   **Solution**: Implement validation of the response.
