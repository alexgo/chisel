It is written in Go and follows the client-server architecture. The project uses secure communication for tunneling and supports TLS encryption. However, the analysis has identified a potential data compliance issue in the 'udp.go' file where IP addresses or other identifying information could be stored, potentially breaching GDPR if not handled correctly. This could impact the overall architecture if changes are needed to ensure data compliance.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with the identified data compliance issue is high. If the data is not anonymized or explicit consent is not obtained before storing, it could lead to legal repercussions and damage to the company's reputation. The risk is further increased by the fact that the issue is present in the 'udp.go' file, which is a critical part of the network tunneling functionality of the software.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: Customers could be affected if their personal data is being stored without their consent or not being anonymized properly. This could lead to a loss of trust in the software and potential legal action from customers. It is recommended to address this issue promptly to mitigate any potential negative customer impact.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project source is good with only one file having detected issues. However, the severity of the issue is high, and it is recommended to address it promptly. The project follows the Go programming language style and structure, and no specific architectural problems were identified.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- The overall health of the project source is good with only one file ('udp.go') having detected issues. This represents a small percentage of the total project files.\n- However, the severity of the issue is high, which increases the overall risk for the project.\n- It is recommended to address this issue promptly to mitigate the risk and ensure the overall health of the project.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The software project follows the client-server architecture and uses secure communication for tunneling.\n- A potential data compliance issue was identified in the 'udp.go' file, which could impact the overall architecture and increase the risk for the project.\n- The potential customer impact is high if their personal data is being stored without their consent or not being anonymized properly.\n- The overall health of the project source is good with only one file having detected issues. However, the severity of the issue is high, which increases the overall risk for the project.",
