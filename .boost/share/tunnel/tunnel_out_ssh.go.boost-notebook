The Chisel project is a fast TCP tunnel over HTTP, which allows users to expose local servers to the internet or access remote servers securely.\n\nThe `import` statement at the top of the code imports several packages that are used within the code. These include standard library packages like `fmt` (for formatted I/O), `io` (for basic input and output), `net` (for network I/O), and `strings` (for string manipulation). It also imports several packages from the Chisel project itself (`github.com/jpillora/chisel/share/cio`, `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share/cnet`, `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share/settings`) and `github.com/jpillora/sizestr` for size string parsing. The `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package is used for SSH-related operations.\n\nThe `handleSSHRequests` function is a method on the `Tunnel` type. It takes as an argument a receive-only channel of pointers to `ssh.Request` objects. This function is likely meant to be run as a goroutine, as it loops indefinitely over the `reqs` channel, handling incoming SSH requests.\n\nWithin the loop, it uses a `switch` statement to handle different types of requests. If the request type is \"ping\", it replies with \"pong\". If the request type is anything else, it logs a debug message saying that the request type is unknown. The `Debugf` method is not shown in this snippet, but it is presumably a method on the `Tunnel` type that logs debug messages.\n\nThe algorithm used here is quite simple: it's just an event loop that handles incoming requests. The actual handling of the requests is very minimal in this snippet; it's likely that more complex request types are handled elsewhere in the code.\n\nFor more information on the packages and concepts used in this code, you can refer to the following links:\n\n- Go standard library documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/\n- SSH package documentation: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\n- Chisel project on GitHub: https://github.com/jpillora/chisel"

The function is part of a `Tunnel` type, and it's used to handle SSH channels. The function's name is `handleSSHChannels` and it takes one parameter: `chans`, which is a read-only channel of `ssh.NewChannel` type.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the function:\n\n- `func (t *Tunnel) handleSSHChannels(chans <-chan ssh.NewChannel) {`: This is the function declaration. `t *Tunnel` is a method receiver, which means this function is a method of the `Tunnel` type. The `chans <-chan ssh.NewChannel` is a parameter of the function. The `<-chan` keyword means that `chans` is a receive-only channel, so data can only be read from it, not written into it.\n\n- `for ch := range chans {`: This is a range loop that iterates over the `chans` channel. In each iteration, it receives a value from the `chans` channel and assigns it to the `ch` variable. The loop continues until the `chans` channel is closed and all values have been received.\n\n- `go t.handleSSHChannel(ch)`: This is a goroutine, which is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. The `go` keyword means this function call will be executed concurrently with the rest of the code. The function being called is `handleSSHChannel`, which is another method of the `Tunnel` type. The `ch` variable, which holds the current value from the `chans` channel, is passed as an argument to the `handleSSHChannel` function.\n\nIn terms of the algorithm, this function uses concurrency to handle multiple SSH channels simultaneously. Each channel is handled independently in its own goroutine, which allows for efficient use of system resources and improved performance when dealing with multiple channels.\n\nThis code is consistent with the Go idiomatic way of handling multiple channels concurrently using goroutines and range loops.\n\nFor more information about Go concurrency and channels, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#concurrency"

It is written in Go and is responsible for handling a new SSH channel. It accepts a new SSH channel as an argument and doesn't return any value.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the `Outbound` property of the `Tunnel` struct's `Config` is false. If it is, it logs a debug message and rejects the new SSH channel with a `Prohibited` message before returning.\n\nNext, it extracts the protocol from the `ExtraData` of the new SSH channel. It does this by calling the `L4Proto` function from the `settings` package with the `ExtraData` as an argument.\n\nThe function then checks if the protocol is UDP and if the host port is SOCKS. If the host port is SOCKS and the `socksServer` property of the `Tunnel` struct is `nil`, it logs a debug message and rejects the new SSH channel with a `Prohibited` message before returning.\n\nThe function then attempts to accept the new SSH channel by calling the `Accept` method on it. If this fails, it logs a debug message and returns.\n\nNext, the function creates a `stream` from the accepted SSH channel and defers its `Close` method to ensure that the stream is closed when the function returns.\n\nThe function then discards any requests from the SSH channel in a separate goroutine by calling the `DiscardRequests` function from the `ssh` package with the `reqs` as an argument.\n\nNext, the function creates a new logger and opens a new connection. It then logs a debug message with the connection's stats.\n\nThe function then checks if the protocol is SOCKS, UDP, or TCP and calls the appropriate handler function accordingly. If the handler function returns an error, it logs a debug message with the error.\n\nFinally, the function closes the connection and logs a debug message with the connection's stats and any error message.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this function doesn't use any complex algorithms. Instead, it uses conditional logic and function calls to handle different types of SSH channels.\n\nFor more information about SSH in Go, you can refer to the GoDoc page for the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\n\nFor more information about handling SOCKS, UDP, and TCP in Go, you can refer to the GoDoc page for the `net` package: https://pkg.go.dev/net\n\nFor more information about logging in Go, you can refer to the GoDoc page for the `log` package: https://pkg.go.dev/log\n\nFor more information about goroutines in Go, you can refer to the GoDoc page for the `runtime` package: https://pkg.go.dev/runtime"

It's a method of a `Tunnel` struct, which suggests that the project might involve some form of network tunneling.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n```go\nfunc (t *Tunnel) handleSocks(src io.ReadWriteCloser) error {\n\treturn t.socksServer.ServeConn(cnet.NewRWCConn(src))\n}\n```\n\n- `func (t *Tunnel) handleSocks(src io.ReadWriteCloser) error`: This line defines a method named `handleSocks` on the `Tunnel` struct. This method takes a parameter `src` which is of the interface type `io.ReadWriteCloser`. The `ReadWriteCloser` interface in Go's `io` package represents the capability to both read from, write to, and close a data stream. The method returns an error which is a built-in interface type in Go.\n\n- `return t.socksServer.ServeConn(cnet.NewRWCConn(src))`: This line calls the `ServeConn` method on the `socksServer` field of the `Tunnel` struct. It appears that `socksServer` is a server that's capable of handling SOCKS connections. The `ServeConn` method is generally used to handle an incoming connection and it takes as an argument a connection object. Here, it's being passed `cnet.NewRWCConn(src)`, which suggests that a new connection object is being created from `src` using `NewRWCConn` function of `cnet` package.\n\nThe algorithm used here is quite straightforward - it's simply passing the received connection to the SOCKS server to handle. The specifics of how the SOCKS server handles the connection would be defined in the `ServeConn` method of the `socksServer` object, which isn't shown in this code snippet.\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, this code snippet seems to adhere to the general principles of Go and network programming. It's hard to say more without additional context or guidelines.\n\nFor more information on Go's `io` package and the `ReadWriteCloser` interface, you can refer to the Go documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/io#ReadWriteCloser\n\nFor more information on SOCKS protocol, you can refer to this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS\n\nPlease note that the exact behavior of the `ServeConn` method and the `NewRWCConn` function would depend on their implementation in the `socksServer` and `cnet` types, respectively."

It handles TCP connections for the tunnel. The function takes three parameters: a pointer to a logger (`l`), a `ReadWriteCloser` interface (`src`), and a string representing the host and port (`hostPort`).\n\nLet's break down what this function does:\n\n1. It attempts to establish a TCP connection to the `hostPort` using the `net.Dial` function. The `net.Dial` function connects to the address on the named network. In this case, the network is \"tcp\". If there's an error during this process, the function returns the error.\n\n2. If the connection is successful, it creates a pipe between the source (`src`) and the destination (`dst`) using the `cio.Pipe` function. The `cio.Pipe` function copies data from the source to the destination and vice versa, effectively creating a two-way communication channel.\n\n3. The `cio.Pipe` function returns two values: the number of bytes sent (`s`) and the number of bytes received (`r`). These values are logged using the `Debugf` method of the logger (`l`). The `sizestr.ToString` function is used to convert these byte values into a human-readable string format.\n\n4. The function then returns `nil`, indicating that the function executed without any errors.\n\nThis function is a part of the `Tunnel` struct, which suggests that this function is part of a larger system that handles network tunneling. Network tunneling is a method of sending data securely over a network.\n\nThe code is written in Go programming language and it's using standard libraries for network communication and I/O operations. It's following good practices of error handling and logging. There is no obvious conflict with the provided architectural guidelines.\n\nFor more information about network programming in Go, you can visit this link: [Go by Example: TCP Client](https://gobyexample.com/tcp-client)"
