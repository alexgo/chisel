The purpose of this code is to define a new type `wsConn` which is a structure that holds a connection to a WebSocket and a buffer.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- `package cnet`: This line declares the package that this file is part of. In Go, code is organized into packages. A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together.\n\n- `import`: This keyword is used to import other packages that are needed in this code. In this case, three packages are imported:\n\n  - `net`: This is a built-in Go package that provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP, UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.\n  \n  - `time`: This is another built-in Go package that provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.\n  \n  - `github.com/gorilla/websocket`: This is an external package that provides a complete and tested implementation of the WebSocket protocol. The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overheads, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. \n\n- `type wsConn struct`: This line declares a new type named `wsConn`. In Go, a `struct` is a composite data type that groups together zero or more values of different types. Here, the `wsConn` struct contains two fields:\n\n  - `*websocket.Conn`: This is a pointer to a `Conn` type from the `websocket` package. This represents a WebSocket connection.\n  \n  - `buff []byte`: This is a slice of bytes. In Go, a slice is a segment of an array. Slices are indexable and have a length. Unlike arrays, they can be resized. The `buff` slice is probably used as a buffer for data that is being sent or received over the WebSocket connection.\n\nThis code does not seem to have any specific algorithms. It's more about data structure definition and package importation. \n\nFor more information about the imported packages, you can visit:\n\n- `net` package: [https://golang.org/pkg/net/](https://golang.org/pkg/net/)\n- `time` package: [https://golang.org/pkg/time/](https://golang.org/pkg/time/)\n- `gorilla/websocket` package: [https://github.com/gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)\n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, this code snippet does not appear to violate any known principles or constraints. It is modular (contained within the `cnet` package), it uses standard Go idioms (like `struct` for grouping related data), and it leverages external packages to avoid reinventing the wheel (like `gorilla/websocket` for handling WebSocket connections)."

The function name is `NewWebSocketConn` and it takes one parameter, `websocketConn`, which is a pointer to a WebSocket connection. \n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. `func NewWebSocketConn(websocketConn *websocket.Conn) net.Conn {`: This is the function declaration. The function `NewWebSocketConn` takes one parameter, `websocketConn`, which is a pointer to a `websocket.Conn` object. The function returns a value of type `net.Conn`.\n\n2. `c := wsConn{ Conn: websocketConn, }`: This line creates a new `wsConn` object and assigns it to the variable `c`. The `wsConn` struct has one field, `Conn`, which is assigned the `websocketConn` that was passed into the function.\n\n3. `return &c`: This line returns the address of the `wsConn` object `c`. Since `wsConn` implements the `net.Conn` interface (not shown in the provided code snippet), this is a valid return value for the function.\n\nThis function is a simple wrapper that allows a `websocket.Conn` to be used wherever a `net.Conn` is expected. This can be useful in scenarios where you have code that works with `net.Conn` objects, but you want to use it with a WebSocket connection.\n\nThe algorithm used here is very straightforward - it simply wraps the `websocket.Conn` in a struct that implements the `net.Conn` interface.\n\nFor more information on the `net.Conn` interface in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn\n\nFor more information on WebSockets in Go, you can refer to the Gorilla WebSocket package documentation: http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/websocket\n\nAs per the provided architectural guidelines, there are no specific constraints or guidelines mentioned. However, this code appears to be consistent with general good practices in Go, such as using interfaces to allow for flexible code that can work with different types of connections."

This method is used to read data from a WebSocket connection and write it into the provided byte slice `dst`. The method returns the number of bytes read and an error if any occurred. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The method receives a byte slice `dst` as a parameter. The length of `dst` is stored in `ldst`.\n\n2. The code then checks if there's any data in the buffer `c.buff`. If there is, it uses this data as the source of the copy operation (`src = c.buff`) and empties the buffer (`c.buff = nil`).\n\n3. If the buffer is empty, it tries to read a new message from the WebSocket connection `c.Conn.ReadMessage()`. If the read is successful, the message is used as the source of the copy operation (`src = msg`). If there's an error, the method returns 0 and the error.\n\n4. The code then performs the copy operation from `src` to `dst`. It also checks if the length of `src` is greater than the length of `dst`. If it is, it copies as much as possible from `src` into `dst` and stores the remainder in the buffer `c.buff`.\n\n5. If the length of `src` is not greater than `dst`, it copies all of `src` into `dst`.\n\n6. Finally, the method returns the number of bytes copied (`n`) and `nil` for the error (indicating that no error occurred).\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this method uses a simple buffer management strategy to handle cases where the source data is larger than the destination. The `copy` function is a built-in Go function that copies elements from one slice to another.\n\nThis method is not thread-safe, meaning it's not meant to be used concurrently by multiple goroutines. This is not a problem in this case, as the comment at the beginning of the method explains that there should never be more than one reader.\n\nFor more information on Go's `copy` function and slices, you can refer to the official Go documentation: \n- Slices: https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro\n- Copy function: https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#copy"

It is part of a `wsConn` struct and is named `Write`. This method is used to write data to a WebSocket connection. \n\nThe method takes two parameters: a byte slice `b` and returns two values: an integer and an error. \n\nHere is a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `func (c *wsConn) Write(b []byte) (int, error) {`: This line defines the method signature. The `Write` method is associated with the `wsConn` struct, which likely represents a WebSocket connection. The method takes a byte slice `b` as input and returns two values: an integer and an error. The integer typically represents the number of bytes written, and the error represents any issues that occurred during the write operation.\n\n2. `if err := c.Conn.WriteMessage(websocket.BinaryMessage, b); err != nil {`: This line is writing the byte slice `b` as a binary message to the WebSocket connection. If there is an error during this operation, it is captured in `err`.\n\n3. `return 0, err`: If there was an error during the write operation, the method returns `0` (indicating that no bytes were successfully written) and the error.\n\n4. `n := len(b)`: This line is calculating the length of the byte slice `b`, which represents the number of bytes that were intended to be written to the WebSocket.\n\n5. `return n, nil`: If the write operation was successful, the method returns the number of bytes written and `nil` for the error (indicating that no error occurred).\n\nAs for the algorithm used, it's a straightforward write operation to a WebSocket connection using the `WriteMessage` method provided by the WebSocket library. This method likely uses the WebSocket protocol to send the data over the network.\n\nFor more information on WebSockets and the Go `websocket` package, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API): A detailed guide on WebSockets from Mozilla Developer Network.\n- [Go WebSocket package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket): The documentation for the `websocket` package in Go.\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since there are no special architectural guidelines or constraints provided for this software project, we can only say that this code is consistent with common practices for writing data to a WebSocket connection in Go."

The method is named `SetDeadline` and it belongs to the `wsConn` struct (which is presumably a WebSocket connection). This method sets a deadline for future `Read` and `Write` operations. If a `Read` or `Write` takes too long (longer than the set deadline), it will return an error.\n\nThe `SetDeadline` method takes one argument, `t`, of the `time.Time` type. `time.Time` is a struct provided by Go's standard library `time` package, which represents an instant in time with nanosecond precision.\n\nThe method returns an `error`, which is a built-in interface type in Go. This can be `nil` if no error occurred, or it can hold an error object that provides more information about what went wrong.\n\nInside the method, it first calls the `SetReadDeadline` method on the `c.Conn` object, passing `t` as the argument. `SetReadDeadline` sets a time after which future read operations will fail with an error. If an error occurs during this call, it is returned immediately.\n\nIf no error occurs during the `SetReadDeadline` call, it then calls the `SetWriteDeadline` method on the `c.Conn` object, again passing `t` as the argument. `SetWriteDeadline` sets a time after which future write operations will fail with an error. The error from this call is then returned.\n\nThe `SetReadDeadline` and `SetWriteDeadline` methods are part of the `net.Conn` interface in the Go standard library, which is a generic network connection. `c.Conn` is likely an embedded field of `wsConn`, meaning that `wsConn` automatically has all the methods that `c.Conn`'s type has.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is straightforward: it sets deadlines for read and write operations. This is a common practice in network programming to prevent operations from hanging indefinitely and to handle network issues gracefully.\n\nFor more information on the `net.Conn` interface and its `SetDeadline` methods, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn\n\nFor more information on the `time.Time` type, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time \n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, without additional context, it's hard to say whether this code conflicts with any. However, it seems to follow good practices for network programming, including handling potential errors and preventing operations from hanging indefinitely."
