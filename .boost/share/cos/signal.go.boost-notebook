It's a function that prints statistics about the Go runtime when it receives a certain system signal (SIGUSR2). This includes the number of goroutines (lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime) and the memory usage of the Go process.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `//+build !windows`: This line is a build tag that tells the Go compiler to exclude this file when building for Windows. This is because SIGUSR2 is not available on Windows.\n\n2. `package cos`: This line declares the package name, which is \"cos\".\n\n3. The `import` statement: This imports several packages that the code needs. The `log`, `os`, `os/signal`, `runtime`, `syscall`, and `time` packages are part of the standard library. The `github.com/jpillora/sizestr` package is an external package that provides a function for converting sizes to strings.\n\n4. `func GoStats()`: This declares a function named `GoStats` that takes no arguments and returns no results.\n\n5. `const SIGUSR2 = syscall.Signal(0x1f)`: This line declares a constant named SIGUSR2 with the value of the SIGUSR2 signal. The value `0x1f` is the hexadecimal representation of the SIGUSR2 signal in Unix-like systems.\n\n6. `c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)`: This line creates a channel that can receive `os.Signal` values. The channel has a buffer size of 1, meaning it can hold one signal value that hasn't been processed yet.\n\n7. `signal.Notify(c, SIGUSR2)`: This line tells the `os/signal` package to send SIGUSR2 signals to the channel `c`.\n\n8. `for range c`: This starts an infinite loop that receives values from the channel `c`. Each time a signal is received, the loop body is executed.\n\n9. Inside the loop body, the function collects memory statistics from the Go runtime using `runtime.ReadMemStats()`, and then logs the number of goroutines and memory usage using `log.Printf()`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is relatively simple: it's a loop that waits for a specific signal and then logs some statistics. The key aspects of this code are its use of channels and goroutines, which are central to Go's model of concurrency, and its use of the `os/signal` package to handle system signals.\n\nFor more information on these topics, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- Go by Example: Signals: https://gobyexample.com/signals\n- Go by Example: Channels: https://gobyexample.com/channels\n- Go by Example: Goroutines: https://gobyexample.com/goroutines\n- Go Documentation: Package runtime: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/\n- Go Documentation: Package signal: https://golang.org/pkg/os/signal/"

It was originally designed to notify the process that the user had disconnected, but it's also commonly used to instruct applications to reload their configuration files.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n- `func AfterSignal(d time.Duration) <-chan struct{} {...}`: This function takes a `time.Duration` as input and returns a receive-only channel of empty struct. The `time.Duration` represents the amount of time to wait before closing the channel if no SIGHUP signal is received.\n\n- `ch := make(chan struct{})`: This line creates a channel of empty struct. This channel will be closed either when the specified duration has passed or a SIGHUP signal is received.\n\n- `go func() {...}()`: This is a goroutine, a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. The goroutine will run concurrently with the rest of the program.\n\n- `sig := make(chan os.Signal, 1)`: This line creates a channel that can receive `os.Signal` values. The capacity of the channel is 1.\n\n- `signal.Notify(sig, syscall.SIGHUP)`: This line registers the `sig` channel to receive notifications of the SIGHUP signal.\n\n- `select {...}`: The `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations. The `select` statement blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case.\n\n- `case <-time.After(d):`: This case will be selected when the specified duration `d` has passed. The `time.After(d)` function returns a channel that will send the current time after the specified duration.\n\n- `case <-sig:`: This case will be selected when a SIGHUP signal is received.\n\n- `signal.Stop(sig)`: This line deregisters the `sig` channel for the notifications of the specified signals. It's a good practice to stop signal notifications when they are no longer needed to avoid leaking resources.\n\n- `close(ch)`: This line closes the `ch` channel. Closing a channel indicates that no more values will be sent on it.\n\n- `return ch`: This line returns the `ch` channel.\n\nThe function `AfterSignal` uses a goroutine and the `select` statement to wait for either a duration to pass or a SIGHUP signal to be received, whichever comes first. This is an example of using channels for synchronization in Go.\n\nFor more information on Go channels and goroutines, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#concurrency\n\nFor more information on the `os/signal` package, you can refer to the Go standard library documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/os/signal/ \n\nFor more information on the SIGHUP signal, you can refer to this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#SIGHUP"
