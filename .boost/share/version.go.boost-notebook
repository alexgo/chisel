This package likely contains shared code that is used by different parts of the Chisel project.\n\nThe code defines two global variables, `ProtocolVersion` and `BuildVersion`, that store version information about the Chisel project.\n\nHere is a line by line explanation:\n\n- `package chshare`: This line declares the package name for this file. All Go files in the same directory must declare the same package name.\n\n- `var ProtocolVersion = \"chisel-v3\"`: This line declares a global string variable named `ProtocolVersion` and assigns it the value \"chisel-v3\". This variable likely represents the version of the protocol used by the Chisel project. The comment above this line explains that when backwards incompatible changes are made to the protocol, this variable will be incremented to signify a protocol mismatch. This helps in maintaining compatibility between different versions of the software.\n\n- `var BuildVersion = \"0.0.0-src\"`: This line declares another global string variable named `BuildVersion` and assigns it the value \"0.0.0-src\". This variable likely represents the build version of the Chisel project. It might be updated automatically as part of a build process, or manually by the developers.\n\nThere are no algorithms used in this code snippet, as it only contains variable declarations. \n\nThis code follows standard Go conventions for package declaration and variable declaration. It's a good practice to keep version information in variables like this, as it makes it easy to track and update the version of the software and/or its components.\n\nFor more information about packages and variables in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation:\n- Packages: https://golang.org/doc/code.html#PackageNames\n- Variables: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Variables"
