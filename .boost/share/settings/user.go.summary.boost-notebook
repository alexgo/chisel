This issue is of high severity and poses a significant risk to the security of the software. The 'Pass' field in the 'User' struct is storing password in plain text, which can lead to sensitive data exposure if the data is intercepted or the system is compromised. This is a serious security risk as it can lead to unauthorized access. \n\n2. **Insecure Regular Expression and Direct Object References**: The project also has warnings for Insecure Regular Expression and Insecure Direct Object References in the same file `share/settings/user.go`. These issues can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if not addressed.\n\n3. **Overall Health of the Project Source**: The project consists of only one file `share/settings/user.go` and all the issues are found in this file. This indicates that 100% of the project files have issues. This is a significant concern and suggests that the project may need a thorough review and refactoring to address these issues.\n\n4. **Potential Customer Impact**: The issues found in the project can have a significant impact on the customers. Sensitive Data Exposure can lead to unauthorized access to customer data, which can result in loss of trust and potential legal implications. Insecure Regular Expression and Direct Object References can also lead to potential security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n5. **Architectural Consistency**: The project follows the client-server architecture and uses secure communication for tunneling. However, the issues found in the project suggest that there may be inconsistencies in the implementation of these architectural principles. The project may benefit from a review of the architectural guidelines and principles to ensure consistency and adherence to best practices.\n\nIn conclusion, the project has several high-severity issues that need to be addressed. The overall health of the project source is a concern, with all the project files having issues. The potential customer impact is significant, and there may be inconsistencies in the implementation of the architectural principles. A thorough review and refactoring of the project may be necessary to address these issues and ensure the security and reliability of the software.",

It allows users to create secure tunnels to expose local servers to the internet or access remote servers securely. The project follows the client-server architecture and uses secure communication for tunneling.\n\n### Architectural Impact and Risk Analysis\n\n1. **Memory and CPU Usage:** The file `share/settings/user.go` has been flagged for both memory and CPU usage issues. This could potentially impact the performance of the software, especially when dealing with large numbers of User structs stored in memory. The severity of these issues is categorized as 'Information' and 'Warning', indicating that they are not critical but should be addressed to improve the software's efficiency and performance.\n\n2. **Security Risk:** The 'Pass' field in the User struct in `share/settings/user.go` stores password data in plain text in memory. This is a significant security risk and could potentially lead to data breaches if not addressed. It is recommended to hash passwords and only store the hash, using a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt.\n\n3. **Overall Health of the Project Source:** The project consists of one file, `share/settings/user.go`, which has been flagged for issues. This means 100% of the project files have detected issues. However, the severity of these issues is not critical, and they can be addressed with proper code refactoring and optimization.\n\n4. **Potential Customer Impact:** The identified issues could potentially impact the performance and security of the software. Customers may experience slower response times due to high memory and CPU usage. The security risk associated with storing passwords in plain text could also lead to data breaches, damaging the trust and confidence of the customers in the software.\n\n5. **Architectural Consistency:** The project follows the client-server architecture and uses secure communication for tunneling, which is consistent with the architectural guidelines for this development project. However, the identified issues, if not addressed, could potentially impact the overall architectural soundness of the project.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project has some issues related to memory and CPU usage and security, they are not critical and can be addressed with proper code refactoring and optimization. The project follows the architectural guidelines and principles, and with some improvements, it can deliver a secure and efficient command-line tool for network tunneling.",
