Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is divided into two stages: the build stage and the run stage.\n\n1. Build Stage:\n\nThe build stage is where the application is built. It starts with the `FROM golang:alpine AS build` command which pulls the golang:alpine image from Docker Hub. This is a lightweight Go (Golang) Docker image based on Alpine Linux.\n\n`RUN apk update && apk add git` is used to update the package list and install git in the image. Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.\n\n`ADD . /src` adds the contents of the current directory (on the host) to the `/src` directory in the image.\n\n`WORKDIR /src` changes the working directory of the Docker image to `/src`.\n\n`ENV CGO_ENABLED 0` sets an environment variable in the Docker image. CGO_ENABLED is a Go environment variable that enables or disables the use of CGo in Go programs.\n\nThe `RUN go build` command is used to build the Go application. The `-ldflags` option allows you to set linker options. The `-X` flag is a linker option that allows you to set the value of an uninitialized string variable in the Go source code. In this case, it's setting the value of the `github.com/jpillora/chisel/share.BuildVersion` variable to the output of the `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags` command.\n\n2. Run Stage:\n\nThe run stage is where the built application is run. It starts with `FROM scratch`, which creates a brand new, empty Docker image.\n\n`LABEL maintainer=\"dev@jpillora.com\"` sets metadata on the Docker image. In this case, it's setting the maintainer of the image.\n\n`COPY --from=build /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/` copies the SSL certificates from the build image to the run image. This is necessary for the application to make secure connections.\n\n`WORKDIR /app` changes the working directory of the Docker image to `/app`.\n\n`COPY --from=build /tmp/bin /app/bin` copies the built application from the build image to the run image.\n\n`ENTRYPOINT [\"/app/bin\"]` sets the application that will be run when a container is started from the image.\n\nFor more information about Dockerfiles, you can visit the official Docker documentation here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/"
