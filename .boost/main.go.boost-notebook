It's a tool for managing SSH-like reverse and forward tunnels. \n\nThe code starts by importing necessary libraries and packages. It then sets a help message with some basic usage instructions and version information. \n\nIn the main function, it sets up some command-line flags for version and help. The flag package provides a way to define simple command-line flag syntax. It includes boolean switches like 'version' and 'help'. If these flags are present when the program is run, they will print the version or help text and then exit.\n\nThe main function then parses the command-line arguments. If the first argument is 'server', it calls the server function with the remaining arguments. If the first argument is 'client', it calls the client function with the remaining arguments. If there's no argument or an unrecognized argument, it prints the help text and exits.\n\nThe code does not include the implementation of the server and client functions, but based on the context, the server function likely starts a Chisel server, and the client function likely starts a Chisel client.\n\nThis code follows Go's idiomatic style and does not appear to conflict with any architectural guidelines. It's modular and straightforward, which makes it easy to maintain and extend, if necessary.\n\nFor more information on Chisel, you can visit its GitHub page: https://github.com/jpillora/chisel.

It defines a string called `commonHelp` which appears to be a help message for a command-line tool. This message includes some general usage instructions, a list of signals that the tool responds to, and the current version of the tool. The version is constructed from two pieces of data - `chshare.BuildVersion` and `runtime.Version()`. The former is likely a custom version string defined elsewhere in the code, and the latter is a function provided by Go's `runtime` package which returns the Go tree's version string.\n\n2. It defines a function called `generatePidFile` that creates a file named \"chisel.pid\" in the current working directory. This file contains the process ID (PID) of the currently running process. The PID is obtained using the `os.Getpid()` function, converted to a string using `strconv.Itoa()`, and then converted to a byte slice so it can be written to a file. The file is created with permissions set to `0644` (owner can read and write, others can only read). If there's an error during any of this, the program logs the error and then terminates immediately using `log.Fatal()`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is pretty straightforward - get the current PID, convert it to a string, convert that to bytes, and write those bytes to a file. If anything goes wrong, stop execution and log the error. \n\nFor more information on the Go functions and packages used here, you can refer to the official Go documentation:\n\n- `os.Getpid()`: https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Getpid\n- `strconv.Itoa()`: https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#Itoa\n- `ioutil.WriteFile()`: https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#WriteFile\n- `log.Fatal()`: https://golang.org/pkg/log/#Fatal\n- `runtime.Version()`: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#Version\n\nRegarding the architectural guidelines, since there are no additional special architectural guidelines or constraints provided for this software project, this code does not appear to conflict with any architectural guidelines. It's a simple, straightforward piece of code that performs a specific task."

It explains the usage and options of the `chisel server` command. The command seems to be for setting up a server with various parameters.\n\nHere are the options it explains:\n\n- `--host`: This option is used to define the HTTP listening host or the network interface. If not specified, it defaults to the environment variable HOST and if that is not set, it falls back to 0.0.0.0, which means it listens on all available network interfaces.\n\n- `--port` or `-p`: This option is used to define the HTTP listening port. If not specified, it defaults to the environment variable PORT and if that is not set, it falls back to port 8080.\n\n- `--key`: This deprecated option is used to seed the generation of an ECDSA public and private key pair. It defaults to the CHISEL_KEY environment variable. If not set, a new key pair is generated each run. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a cryptographic algorithm used for digital signatures. It is known for providing the same security with shorter key lengths than other algorithms, which makes it faster with less computational overhead.\n\n- `--keygen`: This option is used to specify a path to write a newly generated PEM-encoded SSH private key file.\n\n- `--keyfile`: This option is used to specify a path to a PEM-encoded SSH private key. When this flag is set, the `--key` option is ignored. It defaults to the CHISEL_KEY_FILE environment variable.\n\n- `--authfile`: This option is used to specify a path to a users.json file. This file should contain an object with users defined in a specific format.\n\nThis code does not contain any specific algorithms but it provides a user-friendly way to understand the use of different command-line options for configuring a server.\n\nFor more information on command-line interfaces, you can visit this link: [Command-line interface - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)\n\nFor more information on ECDSA, you can visit this link: [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)"

It appears to be part of a command-line tool that implements a server with various options for configuration. The server is part of the \"chisel\" project, which is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP.\n\nThe code starts with a long comment block describing various command-line flags that can be passed to the server command. These flags control various aspects of the server's behavior, such as whether it uses keepalive messages, whether it supports SOCKS5 proxying, whether it allows reverse port forwarding, and how it handles TLS encryption.\n\nThe `server` function is the main function that implements the server command. It starts by creating a new flag set with the `flag.NewFlagSet` function. This flag set will be used to parse the command-line arguments passed to the server command.\n\nThe `config` object is created to hold the configuration for the server. The `flags` object is used to bind each command-line flag to a field in the `config` object. For example, the `--key` flag is bound to the `KeySeed` field, the `--auth` flag is bound to the `Auth` field, and so on.\n\nThe `flags.Usage` function is set to a function that prints the server help message and exits the program. This function will be called if the user passes an invalid flag or requests help.\n\nThe `flags.Parse` function is called to parse the command-line arguments and populate the `config` object.\n\nNext, the function checks if the `--keygen` flag was passed. If so, it generates a new SSH private key and writes it to a file, then exits the program.\n\nThe function then checks if the `--key` flag was passed. If so, it logs a message indicating that this flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n\nThe function then sets the `host` and `port` variables, either from the corresponding command-line flags or from environment variables. If neither is provided, it defaults to \"0.0.0.0\" for the host and \"8080\" for the port.\n\nNext, the function creates a new chisel server with the `chserver.NewServer` function, passing the `config` object. If an error occurs, it logs the error and exits the program.\n\nThe function then sets the `Debug` field of the server object to the value of the `--verbose` flag, and if the `--pid` flag was passed, it calls the `generatePidFile` function.\n\nThe function then starts the server with the `StartContext` method, passing a context that will be cancelled if the program receives an interrupt signal. If an error occurs, it logs the error and exits the program.\n\nFinally, the function calls the `Wait` method of the server object, which blocks until the server is stopped. If an error occurs, it logs the error and exits the program.\n\nFor more information about the Go programming language, you can visit [Go official website](https://golang.org/).

It's defining a new type, `multiFlag`, which is a struct that contains a single field, `values`. \n\nThe `values` field is a pointer to a slice of strings. This means that the `values` field doesn't directly contain a slice of strings, but rather it contains the memory address where a slice of strings is stored. This is useful when you want to modify the slice in a function and have those changes persist outside of the function.\n\nHere is a bit more detail:\n\n- `type multiFlag struct`: This line is defining a new type named `multiFlag`. The `type` keyword is used to define new types. `struct` is a type that groups together zero or more data fields, each of which has a name and a type. \n\n- `values *[]string`: This line is defining a field named `values` in the `multiFlag` struct. The type of `values` is `*[]string`, which is a pointer to a slice of strings. The `*` character is used to denote a pointer, and `[]string` is a slice of strings. \n\nAs for algorithms, this small piece of code doesn't really use any. It's just defining a type, which is a way of grouping related data together.\n\nFor more information about structs and pointers in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation:\n\n- Structs: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types\n- Pointers: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Pointer_types\n- Slices: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Slice_types\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since none were provided, we can only analyze the code based on general good practices. This piece of code seems to follow good practices: it's defining a struct to group related data together, and it's using a pointer to allow for efficient manipulation of a slice of strings."

This specific code is a method on a custom type, `multiFlag`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `func (flag multiFlag) String() string {}` is a method named `String` on the type `multiFlag`. The `String` method is special in Go. When you define a `String` method for a type, it will be automatically called when you use the `fmt.Print` functions with a value of that type or when you use the `%v` format verb. This method is used to provide a custom string representation for the type. The `String` method takes no parameters and returns a string.\n\n- `strings.Join(*flag.values, \", \")`: `strings.Join` is a function from the Go standard library's `strings` package. It concatenates the elements of its first argument to create a single string. The elements are separated by the string provided as the second argument. In this case, `*flag.values` is the slice of strings to join, and `\", \"` is the separator. The `*` before `flag.values` is a pointer dereference. It means we're accessing the values pointed to by the `values` field of the `multiFlag`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is simple and straightforward: it joins a slice of strings into a single string with a specific separator.\n\nFor more information about the `strings.Join` function, you can check the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Join\n\nFor more information about methods in Go, you can check this link: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#methods\n\nRegarding the architectural guidelines, since no specific guidelines or constraints were provided, this code does not violate any. It's simple, clear, and idiomatic Go code. However, without more context about the `multiFlag` type and its `values` field, it's difficult to provide a more detailed architectural analysis."

It represents a method on a custom type `multiFlag`. \n\nThe `multiFlag` type is not defined in this snippet, but based on the context, it seems to be a type that holds a slice of string values. \n\nThe method `Set` is defined on `multiFlag` and takes a string argument `arg`. This method is typically used to set a new value to the `multiFlag`.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the code:\n\n- `func (flag multiFlag) Set(arg string) error {}`: This line is declaring a method named `Set` on `multiFlag` type. This method takes a string argument `arg` and returns an error. The `flag` is a receiver, which means the method `Set` is associated with `multiFlag` type and can be called using an instance of `multiFlag`.\n\n- `*flag.values = append(*flag.values, arg)`: This line is appending the string `arg` to the slice of strings `values` which is a field of `multiFlag`. The `*` before `flag.values` is dereferencing the pointer to the `values` slice. This means we are accessing the actual slice that the pointer is referring to.\n\n- `return nil`: This line returns `nil` indicating that no error occurred during the execution of the method. In Go, it is common to return an error as the last return value in a function or method. If everything goes as expected, the function/method returns `nil` for the error.\n\nThis code doesn't seem to use any specific algorithm, it's a simple implementation of a method on a custom type.\n\nFor more information on methods in Go, you can refer to this link: https://tour.golang.org/methods/1\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this link: https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since there are no special guidelines or constraints specified for this software project, we can assume that this code follows the standard Go conventions and practices."

It's defining a new type called `headerFlags` which embeds the `Header` type from the `http` package.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `type headerFlags struct { ... }`: This line is defining a new type called `headerFlags`. In Go, you can define your own types. Here, the type being defined is a `struct`, which is a composite data type that groups together zero or more values of different types.\n\n2. `http.Header`: This line is an embedded field. It means that all the methods and fields of the `http.Header` type are directly accessible through the `headerFlags` type. The `http.Header` type represents the key-value pairs in an HTTP header, and it's a built-in type from Go's `net/http` package.\n\nThe `http.Header` is a map type, and it's used to represent the header fields in an HTTP request or response. Each key in the map is a header field name, and the corresponding value is a slice of strings representing all the values for that field.\n\nThis code doesn't include any specific algorithms, it's just a type definition. However, it hints at a larger context where HTTP headers are being manipulated or analyzed in some way.\n\nFor more information on Go's type system and the `http.Header` type, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- Go's type system: https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2\n- `http.Header` documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Header\n\nRegarding the architectural guidelines, this code snippet doesn't provide enough context to make a judgment. It's a simple type definition, and it doesn't involve any architectural decisions or principles. However, the use of type embedding is a common practice in Go and it's generally considered good design as it promotes code reuse and simplicity."

This method is used to convert the `headerFlags` object into a string representation.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n- `func (flag *headerFlags) String() string`: This line defines a method named `String` for the type `headerFlags`. The receiver (the type the method is associated with) is a pointer to a `headerFlags` object, denoted by `*headerFlags`. The method returns a string.\n\n- `out := \"\"`: This line initializes an empty string `out`.\n\n- `for k, v := range flag.Header`: This line starts a for loop that iterates over the `Header` field of the `flag` object. The `Header` field is assumed to be a map, where `k` and `v` represent the key and value of each entry in the map, respectively. The `range` keyword is used to iterate over elements in a variety of data structures in Go.\n\n- `out += fmt.Sprintf(\"%s: %s\\n\", k, v)`: This line concatenates the string representation of each key-value pair in the `Header` map to the `out` string. `fmt.Sprintf` is a function that formats and returns a string without printing it anywhere. It uses the format specifiers `%s` for string, and `\\n` is the escape sequence for a new line.\n\n- `return out`: This line returns the final string `out` which contains the string representation of all key-value pairs in the `Header` map.\n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, the code is pretty straightforward and doesn't seem to conflict with any general good practices. It's a simple method that converts a data structure into a string, which can be useful for debugging or logging.\n\nHere is a link to Go's official documentation for more information about methods in Go: https://go.dev/tour/methods"

This method is used to set the header of an HTTP request. The header is represented as a key-value pair, separated by a colon `:`. The key is the header name and the value is the header content. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. The method takes an argument `arg` of type string. This argument is expected to be in the format `HeaderName: HeaderContent`.\n\n2. We use the `strings.Index` function to find the index of the colon `:` in the `arg` string. This function returns the index of the first instance of the specified substring (in this case, the colon) in the given string. If the substring isn't found, it returns -1.\n\n3. If the index is less than 0, it means the colon was not found in the `arg` string. In this case, an error is returned using `fmt.Errorf`, indicating that the header is invalid and should be in the format `HeaderName: HeaderContent`.\n\n4. If the header field of the `flag` struct is nil, it's initialized as an empty `http.Header` map.\n\n5. The `arg` string is then split into key and value at the index of the colon. The key is everything before the colon, and the value is everything after it.\n\n6. The `strings.TrimSpace` function is used to remove any leading or trailing white space from the value.\n\n7. The key-value pair is then set in the `flag.Header` map using the `Set` method.\n\n8. The function ends by returning `nil`, indicating that no error occurred.\n\nThis code doesn't seem to conflict with any architectural guidelines as no special constraints were provided. It's a simple, straightforward function for setting HTTP headers.\n\nFor more information on GoLang's `strings.Index` function, you can visit: https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Index\n\nFor more information on GoLang's `http.Header`, you can visit: https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Header"

Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. This specific part of the code is the client side of the application.\n\nThe code starts with a long string `clientHelp` that provides detailed instructions on how to use the client side of the chisel application, including the various command line options and their usage.\n\nThe function `client(args []string)` is the main function for the client-side application. It takes a slice of strings as arguments, which are the command line arguments passed to the program.\n\nThe `flag.NewFlagSet(\"client\", flag.ContinueOnError)` is used to create a new set of command line flags with the specified name and error handling property. Then, the `flags` variable is used to define and register flags for various configuration options that the chisel client supports.\n\nThe `flags.Parse(args)` line is used to parse the command line arguments.\n\nThe `config.Server = args[0]` and `config.Remotes = args[1:]` lines are used to set the server URL and the remote connections.\n\nThe `chclient.NewClient(&config)` line is used to create a new chisel client with the provided configuration.\n\nThe `c.Start(ctx)` line is used to start the chisel client, and `c.Wait()` is used to wait until the client has stopped.\n\nThe `cos.InterruptContext()` function call is used to create a new context that will be cancelled when an interrupt signal is received.\n\nThis code does not appear to use any specific algorithms. It is mainly about creating a configuration for the client from command line arguments and environment variables, creating the client, and starting it.\n\nHere is the link to the GitHub repository of the chisel project for more information and context: [https://github.com/jpillora/chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)"
